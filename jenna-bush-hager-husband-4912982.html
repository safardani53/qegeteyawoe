Bush</strong>, 76. But aside from being an inspiring career-driven woman, Jenna is a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>devoted wife</a> and mother. And their beginning was priceless! Jenna once revealed that she actually proposed to her future husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I proposed to Henry after several cocktails,” she told <strong>Justin Sylvester </strong>during the August 7, 2023 episode of Today.&nbsp;“I was 22 years old, my sister was standing with us, we were dancing and <strong>Barbara</strong> just started shuffling backwards. She was like, ‘What is happening here?’” Jenna explained. “We’d only been dating three months. He told me he loved me and I’m like, ‘Me too! Let’s get married!’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Below is everything to know about her marriage to <strong>Henry Chase Hager</strong>, 45, and their life together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jenna-Bush-Hager-Husband-SS-embed.jpg><h2>Who Is Henry Chase Hager?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 41-year-old TV personality has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been married</a> to her husband, Henry, for over 14 years. “HH”, as Jenna often calls him, and his wife got married in 2008, about one year before she joined the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY&nbsp;show</a>. Henry is a business executive and previously worked at the Waterous Energy Fund as the Managing Director in 2021, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The US Sun</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He is originally from Richmond, Virginia, and graduated from the Darden School of Business in 2008. The 44-year-old also previously made an appearance on the&nbsp;TODAY&nbsp;show to try out being <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a journalist</a> for a day. “That was tough,” he said after interviewing people on the streets of New York City. “I’m going to get a coffee, warm up and never try this again.”</p><h2>Their Marriage & What She’s Said About Him</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jenna has spoken about her hubby publicly many times, and is often posting about him on social media. The adorable couple got married in 2008, at their family’s Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. The blonde beauty dated Henry while she was still living at the White House during her father’s presidency, and even dished about it during <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an episode</a> of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>‘s&nbsp;WWHL.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>When some fans called in to ask her about the hilarious moment,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Jenna</a> revealed that Henry was caught by the secret service. “Well, he was caught, that was the problem,” she said. “But, as he says it, they are [secret service] supposed to keep people from coming in, they’re not looking for people that are going out.” Henry previously worked for Jenna’s dad, and they met through mutual friends during Bush’s presidency. In addition, the two <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> during a “hiking trip” in Maine, the star told&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hoda Kotb</a>&nbsp;</strong>during <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an episode</a> of their show in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In a May 10, 2023<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram post,</a> she shared that she’s still as in love as ever. “15 years with HH’s hand in mine. I love him. A lot. ❤️❤️,” she captioned the 15th anniversary post.</p><h2>Jenna & Henry’s Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>About five years after Henry and Jenna tied the knot, they welcomed their first daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Mila Hager</strong>, 10, in 2013. Now the duo are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proud parents</a> to a total of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three children</a>, including: <strong>Hal Hager,</strong> 4, and <strong>Poppy Louise Hager</strong>, 8. On Sept. 25, 2022, Jenna <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>took her children</a> to her old home, the White House, along with their grandma,&nbsp;<strong>Laura Bush</strong>, 76. “A magical night we will never forget!”, she captioned the sweet snapshot via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>During an August 2023 appearance on The&nbsp;<a tabindex=0 href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-t='{"n":"destination","t":13,"b":1,"c.t":7}' data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a> show, however, Jenna admitted that she was ready to have another child — something Henry wasn’t down with. “It’s sort of time for me to have another baby,” Jenna shared during the August 8 episode of Today With Hoda & Jenna. “I’d like to have another,” she said, but did explain that “we’re not.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“Henry put his foot down,” she related of her husband’s opinion on the matter, noting that she had “a little health stuff” during her pregnancy with her youngest child. “He says we have three healthy babies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mepaeZXZfCtLSMoZignaJitba%2FwZqlnWVkbn5zhZdrZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ludivine-sagnier-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ludivine Sagnier Dating Now">&larr;
