Although Victoria was hesitant about forming a connection with anyone due to her relationship with&nbsp;<strong>Johnny DePhillipo</strong>, she decided to give it a shot with Alex. Victoria and Johnny were separated during split week, which is when she opted to take Alex on a date, and they connected on many levels.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s been quite a while since Bachelor Nation has seen Alex, and he made it clear that he’s looking for something serious out of his time on&nbsp;BIP. Considering Victoria also admitted to wanting kids sooner rather than later, she was glad that they were on the same page about the future. During the Oct. 25 episode, Victoria will have to face Johnny for the first time after her date with Alex. Ahead of the drama-filled episode, learn more about Alex below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alex-Bordyukov-5-things-bachelor-in-paradise-embed1.jpg><h2>1. What Happened To Alex on ‘The Bachelorette’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Alex was on&nbsp;The Bachelorette&nbsp;back in 2017 for the show’s 13th season. He dated&nbsp;<strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong> on the show. Alex received a group date rose during week three. However, he never earned a one-on-one date with Rachel. Despite not having much alone time with the Bachelorette, Alex still made it to week six before he was eliminated. He was then on season two of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise Australia in 2019, as well as season 1 of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise Canada in 2021.</p><h2>2. Alex Dated Bachelor Nation’s Caroline Lunny</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>On&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise Australia, Alex was one of the first arrivals on the beach. He initially connected with&nbsp;<strong>Brooke Blurton</strong>, but she left the show during week 6.&nbsp;<strong>Caroline Lunny</strong>, who was on&nbsp;<strong>Arie Luyendyk’s</strong> season of&nbsp;The Bachelor (US), arrived during week 7, and she and Alex hit it off. They decided to leave the show as a couple before the final rose ceremony. Although they dated for a few months, they eventually split. “We ultimately decided we weren’t going to pursue it,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MammaMia</a> in 2019. “We still maintain a friendship, we speak on a weekly basis, but there’s no more romantic involvement.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alex-Bordyukov-5-things-bachelor-in-paradise-embed2.jpg><h2>3. Alex Was A College Athlete</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>In college, Alex was on the swim team at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wayne State University</a> in Detroit, Michigan. He was on the swim team for all four years that he was in college. Alex received the DII ADA Academic Achievement Award during his junior and senior years, as well.</p><h2>4.
