I enjoyed myself in the villa and I didn’t exercise a lot.</p><p>“I liked to treat myself every now and again with food. I’m hoping to start training again soon. I find it good, physically and mentally. I need to sort my diet out, that’s the main thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603595055.jpg><p>"You can work out but if you don’t have a meal plan with a decent diet you’ve got no chance. Hopefully AJ will give me some tips on getting a six-pack back.”</p><p>He admitted how a lifetime of on/off dieting has had a negative impact on both his mental and physical health, so he wanted to find something that would work for him.</p><p>The professional dancer gushed about his healthier lifestyle last year, he said: "WW it's going fantastic, really well I've got to say.</p><p>"I haven't been weighed in for my second weigh in so I'd be lying if I gave you a figure of how much I've lost."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/407cc4fc-0c89-415f-a9e6-8e8e545be2a1.jpg><p>He added: "But I feel great, I feel very, very good actually and slimmer than I have been in a long time.</p><p>"I feel healthier, still a bit tired just from travelling around but apart from that I feel great."</p><p>As an ambassador for the brand, the reality favourite followed in the footsteps of singer Robbie Williams&nbsp;and This Morning reporter Alison Hammond.</p><p>His latest weight loss snap comes after his ex Maura, 29, opened up about their split earlier this year and how quickly he had moved on with dancer Amber Pierson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000570376799-3.jpg><p>Speaking to The Sun's Fabulous magazine, Maura recalled her fears that Curtis had cheated on her during their eight-month romance — despite his denials.</p><p>Maura, said: “It’s kind of a kick in the teeth that I’ve been cheated on by my last two boyfriends, but I will be stronger for this.”</p><p>When asked about moving on she told the mag: “Everything happens for a reason and, to be honest, I wish him all the best.</p><p>"I’m in a good place now. It’s not nice to see but I’m fine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603674207-1.jpg><p>The former grid girl took a swipe at Curtis after a Love Island fan slammed the ballroom dancer on the social media site.</p><p>There was previously speculation about Curtis' relationship with Amber, and Irish beauty Maura is raging that she didn't "follow her gut".</p><p>Maura tweeted, "The truth always comes out in the end" then posted on Instagram: "Always trust your first gut instincts. If you genuinely feel in your heart and soul that something is wrong, it usually is."</p><p>Curtis had insisted that he and Amber were simply pals after rumours grew that their relationship began before he and Maura split in March.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600616092-2.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>A source told us: "Maura feels humiliated, as she had suspicions of Curtis cheating and believes now she should have trusted her gut feeling at the time. She feels she stayed in the relationship too long and should have cut ties when she started to have doubts.</p><p>"Curtis is adamant his relationship with Maura ended long before his romance started with Amber.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"But he’s not stupid and can see how it looks.</p><p>"Maura is in a really great place right now, though. She’s got really good mates around her and is focusing on herself, on her career and the many exciting projects she has coming up.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpYmp9cnyXbmalp6aaeqq%2Fy5qlnatdmMKzwMisZKmqmamwqa3RnWSsoahivaKvymarqKicmsC0eceoo6Kcka56uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-stephen-shank-19850729-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Stephen Shank (Model) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
