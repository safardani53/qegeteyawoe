That’s something my wife and I deal with every year and that we struggle with every year,” the&nbsp;football quarterback added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He reportedly had that session&nbsp;with missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in his hometown of Pocatello, Idaho.</p><h2>Taysom Hill’s Wife Helps Him Keep a Balance</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>During the same conversation, Hill particularly talked about the struggles he and his family had due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>According to him, he found it hard to balance between his <a href=# rel="follow noopener">family and work</a> due to&nbsp;the pandemic, as it kept interrupting&nbsp;his usual offseason routine. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He was even forced to hit restricted free agency for the first time before he signed a two-year — reported a $21 million contract extension — to stay with the Saints through the 2021 season&nbsp;in early 2020.</p><p>"My life is out of balance in a great way where I can spend a lot of time with my wife, with my other family members and I can take care of them," Hill said, explaining that he utilized the&nbsp;offseason to spend more time with his family.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>NFL star</a> simultaneously alluded to his better half, Nixon, for helping the family get through&nbsp;the challenging times. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple apparently had good communication between them and encouraged each other to become&nbsp;excellent at whatever they did.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"My wife and I study the scriptures together, we pray together every night, and that doesn’t matter if we’re away from each other or it’s the offseason," he shared.</p><h2>Taysom Hill and Wife Are Now Parenting Their Baby</h2><p>In the midst of the pandemic, in August 2020, Hill and&nbsp;Nixon <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed</a> their first baby together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Taysom Hill and his wife, Emily Nixon, with their baby boy. </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The football player announced the news through his personal Twitter handle, stating he was&nbsp;short of words to describe the love and gratitude he and his partner were feeling at the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"So proud of my wife, Emily, for all the sacrifices she has made, continues to make and how well she did in delivery," he also praised his longtime partner while revealing the baby boy's name as&nbsp;Beau Nixon Hill.</p><p>Hill reportedly missed out on the&nbsp;New Orleans Saints practice for a few days to be present with his missis on a special day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Words cannot describe the love and gratitude Emily and I are feeling right now. So proud of my wife, Emily, for all the sacrifices she has made, continues to make and how well she did in delivery. Finally, happy birthday to my little man, Beau Nixon Hill!

Meanwhile, Nixon, like before, seems to be helping him find that balance.</p><p>For instance, on January 28, 2021, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Instagram</a> to reveal that his spouse took care of the baby on her own when he was away for games. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He also mentioned that he had no idea how challenging it would be to be a parent before he had his son, Beau.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyRrsCwuYyhoKWkXay2p7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joe-garagiola-19260212-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Garagiola (Baseball Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
