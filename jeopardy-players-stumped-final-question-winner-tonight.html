I had no clue and just wanted to write something down! Third most famous invaders is just a wild clue to me."</p><h2><strong>CONTROVERSIAL DEFEAT</strong></h2><p>Viewers were recently <a href=#>upset over another Final Jeopardy! question</a> after nine-day champion Ben Chan's streak ended over an&nbsp;<a href=#>"incredibly harsh" Final Jeopardy spelling ruling</a>.</p><p>Ben's shocking defeat on Tuesday after a record nine runaway wins and $256,000 came down to just one wrong letter and left viewers up in arms.</p><p>Lynn Di Vito - who technically beat Ben - faced Joyce Sun, a retired lawyer from Bloomfield, <a href=#>New Jersey</a>, and Ed Petersen, a planning technician from Orlando, <a href=#>Florida</a>.</p><p>Lynn- a retired museum educator from Colorado Springs, <a href=#>Colorado</a> won with $11,800 after the controversial call.</p><p>Opening Wednesday's show,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;complimented Lynn for her win against Ben and didn't mention the tough way Ben went out.</p><p>“She defeated the seemingly undefeatable 9-game winner Ben Chan in a come-from-behind victory! We are happy to welcome her back," she said at the time.</p><p>All three Daily Doubles went missed, and the timer ran out with three clues left on the board.</p><p>Newcomer Joyce lead going into Final Jeopardy! with $10,800 while Ed had $10,400 and Lynn $6,400.</p><p>Final Jeopardy! under "Classical Music" read: "When the opera 'Lohengrin' premiered in 1850, this man, a future in-law of the composer, was the conductor."</p><p>Everyone was incorrect and no one could guess it was composer Franz Liszt.</p><p>Ed made the smallest wager of $2,401 and became the new winner with $7,999, looking thrilled to do so.</p><h2><strong>'I WILL NO LONGER WATCH'</strong></h2><p>Fans were less thrilled, and people on Twitter were still not buying the results of the earlier game.</p><p>One person tweeted at the time: “Ben Chan was cheated and Jeopardy! fans are furious he lost a 9-day winning streak over a rotten final ruling.</p><p>“I no longer watch Jeopardy! after being a super-fan for 40 years."</p><p>Another person wrote: "I'll watch again when&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>&nbsp;returns. Jeopardy! is messy and will not change until Mayim leaves!"</p><p>A third wrote: "I’ll skip this, and I won’t watch ONE MORE episode until you say why Ben Chan was robbed!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy!.com:</a>&nbsp;“Jeopardy! is not a spelling test – unless, of course, the category requires it.&nbsp;</p><p>"Written responses to the Final Jeopardy! clue do not have to be spelled correctly, but they must be phonetically correct and not add or subtract any extraneous sounds or syllables.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/players-completely-stumped-wild-final-820763333.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/players-completely-stumped-wild-final-820763337.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/fans-disbelief-champion-ben-chan-819993496.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYmd9dH2VaKGep6CWv6XFjKmjmrGVp8Buv9OupKmdlGKzqrrApWSqrZWowaq7zWauoqaemr9uwM6noKCgpGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./o-t-genasis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="O.T.
