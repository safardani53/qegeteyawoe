But not for Cuban model Yvette Prieto. Her marriage had already made headlines before her marriage to NBA legend Michael Jordan. The agreement, however, did little to deter the lovebirds as they not only got married but also had twins of their own. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Cuban native is a well-known model&nbsp;who has modeled for various fashion brands and most prominent fashion designers including Alexander Wang. She also appeared in the documentary titled Cuba: An Island Apart as herself.</p><p dir=ltr></p><p dir=ltr>Yvette Prieto and husband Michael Jordan attends NBA game in 2018 (Photo: usatoday.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>The 39-year-old was born in Cuba in 1978. Apart from her country of origin, little has the busty model revealed about her childhood and her upbringing.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>However, her love life has been an open book for all to read. She dated Spanish singer&nbsp;Enrique Iglesias’s brother Julio Iglesias Jr. in the past for a few years before being together with another love interest.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>See Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Tyra Banks On Weight Gain, Pregnancy Issue, Baby Daddy Split, Daughters - Measurements & More</a></p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>Signs Multi-million Pre-Nup With Fiancee Michael Jordan&nbsp;</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>After, Julio, she&nbsp;met basketball legend Michael Jordan while dancing at a club in 2008. Immediately after the meeting, they started dating each other and moved in together in 2009. Two years later, despite having a huge age difference of 15 years between them, the couple got engaged. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>After five years of being together, the couple moved in towards a natural progression of marriage. However, before getting married, Jordan insisted on Yvette signing a prenup that would save Jordan’s fortune of $650 million. The prenup signing&nbsp;wasn’t a surprising move from Jordan’s behalf as he had once paid a record settlement of $168 Million to his former wife, Juanita Vanoy. Having three kids from their relationship, Juanita received a huge payment as spousal support and divorce settlement fees.&nbsp;Jordan was determined to not make the same mistake as before should the worst happen.</p><p dir=ltr>However, Yvette made it clear that she was not marrying Jordan because he was a sugar daddy and the couple had real love between them by signing up the contract.&nbsp;There was a catch in the agreement though,&nbsp;as&nbsp;Yvette would receive $1million for every year that they stayed married should the couple end up divorcing.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Bonus Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Sam Asghari, Britney Spears' Boyfriend Wiki: Age, Family, Job, Net Worth</a></p><p dir=ltr>Despite knowing Jordan's history in being in relationships, Yvetta signed the agreement with a strong faith in Jordan, as she believed that the prenup would never come to play.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>Michael Jordan & Yvette Prieto's Expensive Wedding</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>Michael spent no expense on his marriage to his love, Yvette Prieto. The ex-Nba star now a billionaire businessman made sure that the couples special day would be like no other.&nbsp;Soon after signing the prenup in 2013, Michael Jordan spent&nbsp;precisely a figure of $10 million on his lavish second wedding with&nbsp;Yvette. The famous NBA legend tied the knot with Yvette Prieto on 27 April 2013 in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p dir=ltr>The dynamic duo said "I Do" at Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea. They then headed to a lavish reception, coordinated by star wedding planner Sharon&nbsp;Sacks, in a large tent at Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The bride looked stunning in a French silk J'Aton Couture gown with Swarovski crystals, whereas the groom rocked a black tuxedo complete with a bowtie and black shoes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr></p><p dir=ltr>Yvette Prieto & husband Michael Jordan enjoy their first dance as newlywed on 27 April 2013.

The twins became the fifth children NBA Hall of Famer would look after. Micheal is also the father of three children from his previous wife, Juanita.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>As of 2019, the couple is enjoying a happy married life with their five children. It seems that the love in the family of Jordans is strong and ever-growing. Let's just hope it keeps going as per the vows said: "Till Death Do Us Apart". <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnqauytcDEZqeroZWpvG7DxJ2boqaXYsG4tc2sZKShlKh7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alec-baldwin-arrested-after-allegedly-punching-a-man-in-nyc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alec Baldwin Arrested After Allegedly Striking a Man in NYC">&larr;
