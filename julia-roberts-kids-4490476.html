Julia and George have known each other for years, and actually worked on a movie,&nbsp;</span>Ocean’s 12<span>, at a very crucial time in Julia’s life — her first pregnancy! Julia starred in the film alongside George, </span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a><span> and&nbsp;</span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matt Damon</strong></a><span>, and said that they were all incredibly sweet to her while she was expecting.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“It was such a sweet shift in our relationships because originally, it was all pranks and teasing each other,” Julia told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Allure</a>. “And here I am pregnant, so it’s like, them pulling out my chair and just making sure I have enough water and, ‘Are you feeling okay?'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Flash forward 18 years later, and Julia is now the proud mom of three children: twins <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hazel </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Phinnaeus</strong></a>, 19, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Henry</strong></a>, 16. She shares her children with husband <strong>Daniel Moder</strong>, 54, a cinematographer who she worked with on the 2000 comedy, The Mexican. They went on to get married in 2002.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Julia and Danny’s kids have grown up so much and are all teenagers now! The couple’s twins <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>turned 19 recently</a>, and Julia celebrated the occasion by sharing an epic throwback picture of Hazel and Phinnaeus when they were babies.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As just about any parent would likely agree, Julia has said that it’s been hard trying to get used to her kids being teenagers. “Danny and I really don’t know what it’s like to be a teenager today. Sometimes my kids ask me things and I just say to them, ‘I’m going to say no, and I’m going to look into it because I don’t even know what we’re talking about,'” she told <strong>Oprah Winfrey&nbsp;</strong>in a 2018 interview for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Here’s everything you need to know about Julia Roberts’ kids!</p><h2>Hazel Moder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/julia-roberts-kids-shutterstock-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Julia and Daniel’s first kids were twins, born in November 2004.&nbsp;<strong>Hazel Moder,</strong> 19, has grown up quite a bit, and looks just like her mom! Julia’s look-alike daughter made her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red carpet debut</a> in July 2021, when she accompanied her dad to the premiere of his movie&nbsp;Flag Day at the Cannes Film Festival.&nbsp;She looked exactly like Julia in an off-white dress and black shoes, with her hair in a ponytail. Besides looks, Hazel does seem like she’s following in her mom’s footsteps to a degree. She made her big screen debut with a tiny role in Julia’s 2016 movie&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mother’s Day</a>. She played the “cartwheel kid,” according to her<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IMDb</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Besides her part in the movie, Julia and Hazel have also bonded over political issues. The actress revealed that she brought her daughter to the 2017 Women’s March in Washington D.C. in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS</a>. The&nbsp;Pretty Woman actress explained that she wanted her to understand what ideas and beliefs she has as a woman. “She had a very strong interest in the election, and I think the result was so surprising to her, as it was to many of us. And I felt it was important for her to feel a sense of participating — you know, that you’re not just in your house and this thing has happened,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Hazel and her dad also have a strong bond. The cinematographer posted a selfie of the teen on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram in September 2019</a> and raved about his little girl. “So lucky this girl is my daughter…and that she takes these awesome selfies on my phone. Staying gnarly,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>When Hazel and Phinnaeus <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>turned 19</a> on November 28, 2023, Julia posted a sweet Instagram tribute featuring a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>throwback picture</a> when they were babies. “There are no words for the joy, the fun, the wild rumpus of life together,” she wrote in her caption.</p><h2>Phinnaeus Moder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/julia-roberts-kids-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Like his twin sister Hazel,&nbsp;<strong>Phinnaeus Moder</strong> is also 19-years-old. While his sister made her film debut a few years ago, it seems like the older Moder son shares interests with his dad. The two were spotted out in matching white t-shirts back in June, and it looks like Phinnaeus is a bit of a skater dude.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Julia Roberts’ kids were actually the reason that she got on Instagram, she told Oprah in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2018 interview</a>, but the Academy Award-winner rarely posts pictures of her children on the app. Her husband does occasionally share glimpses into the family’s life, and he has shown that he and Phinnaeus have a lot in common. Danny has posted photos of himself catching waves, and he’s also occasionally shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of his son on a skateboard. The cinematographer also sometimes shows his great photography skills with photos of his kids, like when he posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gorgeous shot</a> of Phinnaeus throwing a bottle in the desert in June.</p><h2>Henry Moder</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Three years after Julia had Hazel and Phinnaeus, she gave birth to <strong>Henry</strong>, 17, in June 2007. Like his brother, most of what we know about Henry comes from his dad’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> posts. Similar to his older brother, it looks like he has also taken an interest in extreme sports. His dad <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>has posted a ton of videos</a> of him shredding it up on his skateboard, just like his older brother. Besides the sick skateboarding shots, Danny has also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a video of</a> him doing a sweet flip on a trampoline in May 2019. He also called his son “one cool kid” in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 2018 photo.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>With all of Julia Roberts’ kids, it looks like they make for a tight-knit family. Danny has posted photos of all the kids with their mom on a few occasions. He shared a photo of the three surprising Julia on her 50th birthday weekend <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in 2017.</a> “50 is better with 5. This is the road to the tavern where there is promise and joy. Love you,” he wrote. He also posted a photo of the whole family with their “pretty mama in the middle” in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 2019</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8muo6KZXae8o7HRrapmo5mZwG6Ak3JnbW9mZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lindsay-lohan-vanessa-minnillo-knife-wielding-maniacs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lindsay Lohan &amp;amp; Vanessa Minnillo: Knife-Wielding Maniacs">&larr;
