He is also a proud grandpa — which most likely explains his favorite vacation spot.</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything you didn’t know about Adkins:</p><p>1. My favorite place to go on vacation is <a href=#>Disney World</a>. The best thing a parent can experience is a child’s innocent joy, and that’s what I’ve seen there.</p><p>2. I prefer dogs over cats. Cats are a—holes and just too much trouble.</p><p>3. Other than becoming a father, my proudest moment is becoming a member of the Grand Ole Opry. To me, it’s the most prestigious fraternity in country music.</p><p>4. My favorite book is the Farmers’ Almanac. I have a nostalgic connection to it, and I remember my granddaddy reading it religiously.</p><p>5. The first movie I was affected by was <a href=#>Jaws</a>. It completely freaked me out.</p><p>6. Snakes <a href=#>scare me</a>. Growing up in Louisiana, a lot of the snakes there were dangerous.So, I grew up with a very healthy respect — [and] borderline fear — of them.</p><p>7. My favorite meal is fried fish.</p><p>8. The best way to spend a weekend is on a tractor.</p><p>9. My pet peeve is people driving slow in the fast lane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/trace-adkins-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-inline.jpg><p>10. My <a href=#>first real job</a> was sacking groceries at Piggly Wiggly the summer between [my] sophomore and junior year[s] of high school. Before that, I [was] hauling hay.</p><p>11. My worst job was at Piggly Wiggly. I quit!</p><p>12. I can’t live without television. I don’t see how people made it through the evening without television.</p><p>13. I have a lot of bands thatI absolutely love and listen to, but if I was pressed to pick my favorite, it would be <strong>Lynyrd Skynyrd</strong>.</p><p>14. My first concert was <strong>Whitesnake</strong> at First Memorial Coliseum in 1980, I believe.</p><p>15. My total weakness is tobacco.</p><p>16. <a href=#>Christmas</a> is my favorite time of the year, and “The Christmas Song” by <strong>Mel Tormé</strong> is my favorite song.</p><p>17. My favorite show to binge right now is <a href=#>Ozark</a>.</p><p>18. My dream job is being a good-looking mute gun fighter. He rides into town, has a shoot-out, kisses the girl and then rides away with a lot of money. I was born in the wrong century.</p><p>19. My favorite mode of transportation is a pickup truck.</p><p>20. A destination I’d love to visit is Cairo, Egypt.</p><p>21. Something I hate that most people like is dark chocolate. I feel like it’s just a half-hearted effort, like they only got so far with it and said, “We’re just not going to put the sweet stuff [in].”</p><p>22. The most common thing fans say to me is, “You’re so tall!”</p><p>23. My favorite app is The Weather Channel app.</p><p>24. I don’t cook. I can heat something up, but I’m not a cook.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I like the smell of a skunk. Something about the smell immediately takes me back to being 12 years old in the woods and hunting.</p><p>Ultimate Cowboy Showdown airs on INSP Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGYsm6tw6Sgp6tdZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amber-rose-breast-reduction-surgery-meets-with-plastic-surgeon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amber Rose Preps with Doctor Before Breast Reduction Surgery">&larr;
