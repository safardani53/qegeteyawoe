The man twice knocked back as a kid, who went on to become one of the finest showmen in the game.</p><p>Not that you’d have put any money on that in his early teens, for all he was playing three years above his age group at school.</p><p>At 14 QPR gave him a trial and didn’t think he’d make it. Neither did Chelsea, who gave him a trial after spotting him in Sunday football for local side Kiwi United.</p><p>Back then his best chance of earning a crust was picking up a fiver a week at the building firm where he worked as a painter, decorator and plumber.</p><p>Dreams of following his hero Jimmy Greaves – he used to watch Chelsea as a kid – were a million miles away, and his football was confined to Hendon Boys.</p><p>But out of the blue Watford spotted the then-16-year-old who had something, and gave him a six week trial. That turned into a six-month deal and he was on the road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312594522-e1490975295697.jpg><p>Six goals in five reserve games, and the first team at the foot of Division Three brought a debut, and two goals.</p><p>A hat-trick in his third game, and another against Grimsby brought England youth honours – and interest from the top level.</p><p>Sheffield United were just one of many to watch him and bid £26,500 after six months, 18 games and nine goals.</p><p>Watford didn’t want him to go but needed money to renew the lease on the ground, and Currie was heading north at 18.</p><p>Once again he scored on his debut, in a 3-2 win over a Spurs side including Greaves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312594534-e1490975342488.jpg><p>Three days later he got his third England youth cap and three days after that missed the defeat at Leicester because he was marrying Linda.</p><p>Unlike the Bests, Worthingtons and the like, Currie was a family man to the core. It was a cup of tea and the telly rather than &nbsp;a nightclub and the latest Miss World.</p><p>He couldn’t stop the Blades being relegated, but inspired the promotion three seasons later and in all had nine years, 376 games and 66 goals at Bramall Lane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312902148-e1490976118758.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312590254-e1490976346719.jpg><p>His sublime skills – whether picking a pass or curling in a stunning goal – became trademarks.</p><p>Yet arguably his most famous moment came in 1975, when he and Leicester’s Alan Birchenall crashed into each other, puckered up and kissed each other. It was a photo that went global and made the pair gay icons!</p><p>The Blades never truly matched his own abilities, and £240,000 took him to Leeds in 1976, where he was just as popular.</p><p>Three years down the line his missus was homesick for London and he was off to QPR for £450,000.</p><p>Currie helped them to 1982 FA Cup final, captaining them in the replay, but conceded the penalty from which Glenn Hoddle hit the only goal of the game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312594533.jpg><p>On the international stage he won 17 full caps, and was as graceful as any who pulled on an England shirt.</p><p>For all he looked at home with the Three Lions, his critics claim he never did it in a major tournament. He’d have had a job – England had a run of not qualifying!</p><p>Maybe if they’d had a more open-minded national boss in those days, things could have been different, with so many great entertainers overlooked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000312590247-e1490976496666.jpg><p>In the end, the only team honours he won were two runners up medals, for Division Two promotion in 1970-1 and the 1982 FA Cup.</p><p>Individually, though, he was always top dog. Especially at Sheffield United, where they voted him the greatest ever Blade in 2014.</p><p>They’ll be lucky to see his like again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2h%2Fc4GVcXBorJ%2Bjxm6v1Kupop1dna6lecuopaBlkqG8r7CMoZiiql2Wu6V5waWcsGWbnsC0sdJmq6hlpJ2ybq%2FRqK6dZZiaeq27zqScnWWcnrimecBmnqWZnWK%2FsK%2FKnqlmmZ6Zeri0xKdkoZ1drK60ec6nZKynnpx6uK3SZqannV2ks27Ax55km52jqXqxuMCynKurXaSzbsDHnmRwaKNk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emily-ratajkowski-dating-after-split-from-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Ratajkowski Opens Up About Dating After Split from Her Husband">&larr;
