The actor from The Big Lebowski was diagnosed with COVID in January 2021, before the immunizations were made available to the entire population. With an already impaired immune system and intense discomfort, the actor was hospitalized for five months and often required supplementary oxygen.</p><p>“I was on the brink of dying. ‘Jeff, you have to fight,’ the doctors kept urging me. You’re not battling.’ I was ready to give up. I was prepared to go. I was playing with my own mortality. I didn’t have any defenses. Chemo accomplishes just that: it depletes your immune system. I didn’t have anything to combat it with. COVID made my cancer seem insignificant.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jeff-Bridges-3.jpg alt="Jeff Bridges" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Convalescent plasma, a treatment that employs plasma from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies to the virus, has been used successfully by the actor’s medical team.

Everything was ramped up to the highest level.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>As the Dude would say.. New S**T has come to light.</p><p>I have been diagnosed with Lymphoma.
