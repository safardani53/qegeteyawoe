We all have a use. You just need certain things put into you in order to shine.”</p><p>The restoration expert set up the business with Steve, who was trained in upcycling furniture via Jay’s charity Out of the Dark, in High Wycombe, <a href=#>Buckinghamshire</a>.</p><p>Jay added: “The amount of people who have come is surreal and overwhelming. It's crazy.</p><p>“It's unbelievable the impact The Repair Shop has had on people. I've opened a shop because I wanted to show that the high street is not dead, it can still thrive.”</p><p>The new store looks set to become Jay’s latest triumph.</p><p>The star had earlier welcomed <a href=#>King Charles</a> to his workshop and he received an MBE last year.</p><p>He was brought up by his mum, Barbara, on a council estate in Hackney, East <a href=#>London</a>, after his father abandoned them.</p><p>Jay then became involved in <a href=#>gang</a> culture after he left school without any qualifications and ended up homeless in his twenties and suffered a <a href=#>mental breakdown</a>.</p><p>He’s now a dad-of-three and <a href=#>married to Lisa-Marie Zbozen</a>, a fitness trainer.</p><p>Jay said he could have fitted all his possessions into just one carrier bag when he lived in a hostel, before being given social housing on the Victorian Peabody estate.</p><p>Suffering from <a href=#>dyslexia and unable to read</a>, it was only when he turned 51 that he began to tackle his illiteracy problem – after he’d found fame on the show.</p><p>Steve, 45, has also experienced being homeless as well as a 22-year-<a href=#>drug addiction</a> and time behind bars.</p><p>Jay said: “There is no reason why other people can't do what Steve and I have done here.</p><p>"But it's special to do this with Steve because I've known him a really long time.”</p><p>Steve said: “I started restoring things and Jay said to me, 'What can you do differently?' and here it is. Our shop.”</p><p>Foster carer and a Repair Shop fan, Sue Dickson, who had queued up to meet the TV star said: “I think he's brilliant and it is great for the area that he has brought his shop to Poole.”</p><p>Steve said: “Jay and I were sat next to each other on Monday and I said wow, this is the proudest day of my life.</p><p>“There's been lots of interest and we've sold three or four pieces, but as word gets out and people tell their friends about us business should pick up.</p><p>“We want to target people from London who have second homes down here and need furniture for their homes.”</p><p>Many visitors to the shop said they had gone along because they were fans of the TV show.</p><p>Nurse Kathleen Sheret, 62, said: “I love the Repair Shop and I'm gutted I missed the shop opening.</p><p>"I think the stuff in here is adorable and the chairs are stunning.”</p><p>Nearly 300 episodes of The Repair Shop have aired which sees a team of craftspeople restore any item members of the pubic bring in.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>When <a href=#>King Charles visited last year</a>, as part of the <a href=#>BBC</a>’s centenary celebrations, he bought in an 18th century bracket clock and a ceramic antique made for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.</p><p>The show is filmed in a barn at Weald & Downland Living Museum in <a href=#>West Sussex</a> although the public isn’t allowed entry when filming takes place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/w8media-jay-co-poole-dorset-803545740.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/w8media-jay-co-poole-dorset-803545914.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/crowds-pack-view-store-jay-802980738.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/royal-visit-repair-shop-royal-770816970.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGphbIFygpFpZq2glWK%2FprzAoqlmq5ikvW62wLJkm6SRmbK0ecWiqaysXajBsL7EZqapnZ6ofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./javi-ogs-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Javi.ogs Girlfriend: Who is Javi.og Dating?">&larr;
