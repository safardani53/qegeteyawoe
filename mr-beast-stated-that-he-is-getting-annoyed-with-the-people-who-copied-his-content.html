Jimmy is well known for his extravagant, high-budget music videos. He has previously said that each of his films involves many months of preparation in order to be executed successfully.</p><p>With over 100 million YouTube followers, though, the inventor is often imitated by other producers. Morgz, a British YouTuber, is one of MrBeast’s most notoriously accused copycats. In 2018, the latter’s fans and followers accused the former of openly stealing his ideas and thumbnails, leading to a rivalry between the two parties.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Agreed, it’s getting out of hand tbh</p><p>— MrBeast (@MrBeast) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 18, 2022</a></p><h2>The dispute between MrBeast and Morgz</h2><p>In August of 2018, viewers discovered remarkable parallels between the videos of MrBeast and Morgz. Jimmy published a video titled “Can 1,000 Rolls of Duct Tape Stop a Car?” in April 2018. Morgz published a video in August of the same year titled “Can 1,000 Layers of Duct Tape Stop a Car from Hitting Me?”&nbsp;Jimmy acknowledged the parallels in a tweet that has since been removed. Morgz swiftly responded with screenshots of YouTubers who had done the identical video years before to the two, stating that there are others who did it first. Jimmy responded with a video in which he said that he had no animosity toward the English YouTuber. However, Jimmy requested that Morgz alter the material when generating films in his likeness.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Morgz.jpg alt=Morgz width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Morgz instantly answered that he, too, did not desire conflict between the two. He also said that his video’s topic was substantially different from Jimmy’s. Jimmy deleted his initial Tweet in reaction to Morgz’s comment, resolving the debate.&nbsp;A few days after their Twitter argument, @BradHeat reported that Morgz had banned the phrase MrBeast from his account. They published:</p><p>“So I was looking… And it comes out that Morgz has BLACKLISTED the term “MrBeast” so that no one can call him out. Obviously, he is aware of his actions.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>these guys did it first thooo 🤔🤔 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/EMBhLU0twq</a></p><p>— Morgz (@Morgz) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2018</a></p><p>After one of his challenges became popular on November 26, Jimmy tweeted, “What if I invited everyone who participated and had them compete for cash?”&nbsp;However, not all of his admirers supported the idea, and some said that Morgz did not need “additional attention.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MrBeast-1.jpg alt=MrBeast width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Later, in March 2019, a Twitter user uploaded images highlighting the similarities between the video thumbnails of the two artists. Jimmy’s response, however, was what his admirers adored, as he said that imitation was the “highest form of flattery.”&nbsp;The founder FaZe Banks observed the response and said that Jimmy was “far too sweet,” to which Jimmy responded:</p><p>“True, but not all of my actions are unique either. Every day, many individuals imitate me, yet it would be hypocritical of me to get angry with them.”</p><p>Within a week, his response earned over 15,000 likes. Numerous YouTube channels have discussed the content similarities between the two producers.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikq2WSmq60wIysq5qslZl6tbTArWShnV2ewG6zxK2roqaXYq6vus6ynJ1lp57BqXnToZxmqJWkva2xjLCfqGWTpL2qscNmn6KrXZi8r8DEp6to</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-kendji-girac-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Kendji Girac Dating Now">&larr;
