I'm not doing that!"</p><p>When the man began to spit, Heidi ducked down, causing him to miss her mouth, and body completely.</p><p>Heidi wagged her finger as she stepped away from them, but the men seemed to take it in stride.</p><h2>WOW-IE, HOWIE!</h2><p>Another shocking moment happened during the live show, but this time it was between two judges.</p><p>When Brynn Cummings, a 12-year-old ventriloquist, came on stage to perform, Howie <a href=#>delivered a jab to Sofia</a> instead of giving the act feedback.</p><p>Her act was centered around her puppet, which is a pink skunk, and how she wanted to find love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/howie-slammed-brutal-jab-sofias-839568968.jpg><p>Brynn came prepared with a binder full of potential animals for her skunk to date.</p><p>The 12-year-old asked Heidi to help the skunk pick out a potential suitor.</p><p>While Heidi was successful in finding the puppet the perfect match, a love bird, Howie had a different thought.</p><p>He was the first to speak after Brynn's act was over.</p><p>Howie said: "You're adorable and you blend magic and ventriloquism and you deserve to be here."</p><p>The former gameshow host continued: "If I have one word of advice if you're looking for eligible bachelors, you should have talked to Sofia because she's in the market right now."</p><p><a href=#>Sofia</a> recently <a href=#>got divorced</a> from her husband, <a href=#>Joe Manganiello</a>.</p><p>Host <a href=#>Terry Crews</a> came out from behind the stage and scolded the judge for his mean comment.</p><p>"No! No! We are not doing that," he yelled before he changed the subject.</p><p>However, Sofia didn't seem to mind Howie's jab as she threw her hands up and yelled: "Yeah!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/howie-slammed-brutal-jab-sofias-839568959.jpg><h2>'GOT IT WRONG!'</h2><p>Simon was scolded by AGT fans when <a href=#>he had harsh words</a> for a contestant, who performed on the live show.</p><p>John Wines delivered a rock 'n roll performance on the guitar, along with background dancers.</p><p>Howie, Heidi, and Sofia seemed to have enjoyed John's performance, but Simon did not.</p><p>He didn't like it so much so that he buzzed John halfway through his performance.</p><p>Simon started off by saying that he didn't think John's wife will be very happy when she watches his performance back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/agts-simon-cowell-blasted-beyond-839668681-2.jpg><p>"I just thought the whole thing-. I don't know what it was. I just felt strange," Simon told the 59-year-old.</p><p>The crowd booed the judge before moving on to the other judges' comments, which were a lot nicer.</p><p>Fans were not happy with Simon's feedback and took to the comments of where the performance was posted on social media to tell him.</p><p>"Why was it strange? He is incredible," asked an Instagram user.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Yes it was strange but that’s the whole point Simon…. Not many old men like that can play the guitar like him which I think is pretty damn amazing if you ask me!" said one&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube&nbsp;</a>user.</p><p>"First time I don’t agree with Simon he’s absolutely shredded it was so focused didn’t even hear the x," said another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/agts-simon-cowell-blasted-beyond-839668721-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/agts-simon-cowell-blasted-beyond-839668683.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/agts-simon-cowell-blasted-beyond-839668725-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaWeEeYKRaJimnaKesKK%2FjKCmrWWklrmmutNmmquZqp6ytMCMpaCvnV2ivK6xza2qZqyYnsBuv8SaqqimXWaFcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aviation-youtuber-and-dad-die-in-tennessee-plane-crash-8413476.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aviation YouTuber, 45, and Her Dad, 78, Die in Tenn.
