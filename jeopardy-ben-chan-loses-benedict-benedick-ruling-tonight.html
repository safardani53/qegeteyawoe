">Read more on Jeopardy!</h2><p>On Tuesday's shocking episode, Ben got off to another strong start, but a missed True Daily Double that brought him back to $0.</p><p>He built back a commanding lead in the Double Jeopardy! Round, but then missed the last Daily Double - so for the first time during his impressive streak he did not have the game put away.</p><p>Going into Final Jeopardy, Ben had $17,400, Lynn- who got the second Daily Double correct - was right behind at $14,800, and Danny had $2,400.</p><p><a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 48, remarked: “Lynn is indeed within striking distance,” before presenting the suddenly crucial last clue.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>'UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S INCORRECT'</h2><p>Final Jeopardy under "Shakespeare's Characters" read: “Both of the names of these 2 lovers in a Shakespeare play come from Latin words for ‘blessed’.”</p><p>Danny wrote down “Romeo and Juliet” which was deemed incorrect, as did Lynn, she wagered $3000 leaving her with 11,800.</p><p>Mayim finally turned to Ben who revealed he wrote “Beatrice & Benedict Benedict,” striking out the first “Benedict” but then writing it the same the second time.</p><p>After a moment of <a href=#>pause</a>, Mayim ruled it was incorrect: “Unfortunately that is not correct. The correct response [is] Beatrice and Benedick.”</p><p>“From Much Ado About Nothing,” Mayim concluded- but she didn't go further in explaining the judgment call.</p><p>Ben revealed he wagered $12,201 and slapped the podium in disappointment as he was left with $5199 and in second place.</p><p>Lynn was declared a one-day champion and looked thrilled as Ben kindly clapped for his victor.</p><p>Mayim concluded: "Ben what a terrific run we will see you in the next <a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>."</p><h2>'THEY SOUND THE SAME'</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy!.com:</a> “Written responses to the Final Jeopardy! clue do not have to be spelled correctly, but they must be phonetically correct and not add or subtract any extraneous sounds or syllables.”</p><p>Viewers hotly debated how Ben lost on social media, and if Ben's otherwise correct response did change the pronounciation enough to be wrong.</p><p>One person accused under a YouTube clip: “He was cheated. Completely unfair ruling on name Benedick."</p><p>“SHOCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;OFF BY JUST 1 LETTER!” another simply wrote.</p><p>"Very rotten final ruling on Final @Jeopardy tonight. Google the answer and BOTH Benedick and Benedict come up. Both spellings are accepted," tweeted a third.</p><p>On Reddit fans more closely discussed if the ruling was fair game, one writing: “Ouch.. quite a hard Final Jeopardy anyway, and then a <a href=#>harsh ruling</a>… shame for Bens run to come to an end!"</p><p>Another defended the show and wrote: “That Final Jeopardy ruling was super harsh. Very disappointing way for Ben to lose and he was on the cusp of becoming a super-champ [or 10-day winner]. However, I guess it is consistent with previous rulings so there's not much one can do here."</p><p>A third wrote: "I'm gonna be one of the first to say it. That Final Jeopardy ruling is incredibly harsh to me."</p><p>"If you google online, so many people make reference to the fact that people mishear it as Benedict.</p><p>"In fact when I heard Mayim say it I didn't quite understand what was wrong with the response until I googled it to realize the spelling."</p><p>"Since Final Jeopardy is supposed to be by pronounciation, I'm not entirely sure why it wasn't given (Benedict and Benedick really sound the same in my opinion)."</p><p>I hope that there's a reversal in the next day's taping, and both are returned as co-champions."</p><p>Another fan agreed: "This was a two-substantive word answer. Only one of the two substantive words was off, and by one letter at that. "T" is so often omitted in American pronunciation that there are memes about it.</p><p>"The etymology of Benedick and Benedict is identical. This was BS."</p><p>A fifth wrote: "That was weird. I replayed it and replayed it and couldn't understand/ hear the difference."</p><p>A sixth person sided with the show: "Oof, a heartbreaking way for Ben to lose--missing 2 kind of odd, wordplay/letter search Daily Doubles, then still having the lead going into Final Jeopardy but losing on a triple stumper by being one letter off the correct response while his opponents weren't even close (I think that was the correct ruling, though)."</p><p>Other viewers evoked the controversial <a href=#>"Harriet Tubma-" Final Jeopardy ruling</a> from last season in which contestant <a href=#>Sadie Goldberger</a> would have won but was deemed incorrect and their response "incomplete".</p><p>Others yet wondered if Ben should have simply left the last letter off completely and if so if he'd still be the champion- let alone if the ruling was fair anyway.</p><p>“If Ben had left off the last letter in his Final Jeopardy response, it likely would have been accepted, as it would be pronounced the same way as if it was spelled correctly.”</p><h2>'I WAS SO CLOSE'</h2><p>Ben wrote on Reddit that he stood by Jeopardy!’s ruling.</p><p>He wrote in the thread: 1: Benedict is incorrect. The character's name is Benedick. As Ken (presciently) noted on my first episode, there is no partial credit on Jeopardy! (Yes, I was sooo close!)."</p><p>"2. I made some bad flashcards. The 'Benedict' misspelling is common, and it worked its way onto a couple of my flashcards."</p><h2>WHO IS: BEN CHAN?</h2><p>Ben has dominated the show these past two weeks with his&nbsp;classic close-to-the-vest buzzer stance- a <a href=#>tribute to his hardoworking father who gifted him his watch.</a></p><p>He became&nbsp;<a href=#>first player since 2001</a>&nbsp;to win his first five games in runaways- and then won in the same fashion the next four episodes.</p><p>A so-called runaway game entails having such an insurmountable lead by Final Jeopardy that a player can't be caught even if the contestant in second place bets everything they have.</p><p>The achievement was not lost on other Reddit users as one recently wrote: "It's official: Ben Chan is the first Jeopardy! contestant to start a run with six lock-games. He is our new god!"</p><p>Ben also shared he beat - then lost to-&nbsp;<a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>&nbsp;at Wisconsin pub trivia, and shares two foster dogs with his wife, apparently Ben's college campus is "buzzing about him right now," according to another recent Reddit user.</p><h2>RECOVERY FROM SUDDEN ILLNESS</h2><p><a href=#>Ben</a>&nbsp;had earned&nbsp;his first&nbsp;<a href=#>three runaway wins</a>&nbsp;by Friday, April 11's game.</p><p>However, was mysteriously absent from April 14th's episode despite being the reigning champion.</p><p>In a rare occurrence, three new contestants faced off instead and Ben took a leave of absence - he later clarified&nbsp;<a href=#>the real reason he did not return as scheduled</a>.</p><p>“Before yesterday’s episode taped, I had tested positive for Covid; it was a very mild case, as you can see, I’m fine.</p><p>"Most importantly, my buzzer finger is fine, so I’m excited to watch what happens over the next few weeks, see who I’ll be competing against on May 15," he said during a virtual appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Day Wisconsin</a>.</p><p>There have only been four episodes since the early 2000s in which there have been two returning champions in one game.</p><p>Ben's fourth runaway win and return last Monday&nbsp;<a href=#>led to the loss of 8-day champion Hannah Wilson</a>&nbsp;in an unfortunate but not purposeful scheduling move by the show.</p><p>Ben and Hannah were represented as "co-champions" and even if Ben had been scheduled to return this Monday's episode far in advance, it was an unceremonious way for Hannah to lose, hundreds of Twitter users felt.</p><p>"They should’ve waited until Hannah’s run was over until they brought Ben back. Not fair."</p><p>Another user replied: "I think is fair. They scheduled Ben’s return before Hannah came on the show and started going on a streak. Let’s try to celebrate people’s victory."</p><p>Another user replied: "I think is fair. They scheduled Ben’s return before Hannah came on the show and started going on a streak. Let’s try to celebrate people’s victory."</p><p>Ben tweeted: "I do feel bad that my bad luck also was bad luck for Hannah and Wendy."</p><p>"But in the grand scheme, we were obviously all ridiculously lucky to be on&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;Stage."</p><p>That said, there was a possibility Ben would still be the champion when Hannah arrived for her first game in early May.</p><p><a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>&nbsp;is hosting&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters</a> - while his co-successor to&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim,</a>&nbsp;finishes out the regular season until the summer.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>After Masters, Ken won't be seen until the&nbsp;<a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;which will kick off Season 40 in September-which both Ben and Hannah will be in.</p><p>That is, barring the last week of Season 39 which he is&nbsp;<a href=#>subbing back in to host as Mayim</a>&nbsp;is supporting the WGA writers' strike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/fans-slam-player-illness-causing-740650434.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/fans-disbelief-champion-ben-chan-819993494.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYW5%2FeHyYaKGep6CWv6XFjJucp2WTna6vecuoqp6rXZeyr7HDopqtZZKau6awyJyiZqqlobavs4ytpqehl53BcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jerry-oconnell-somehow-marries-rebecca-romijn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jerry O'Connell Somehow Marries Rebecca Romijn">&larr;
