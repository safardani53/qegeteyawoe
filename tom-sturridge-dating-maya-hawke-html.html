The actor, who plays the lead role in the show, has been making headlines left and right. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His dating life is one of the subjects of the said headlines, and his new <a href=# rel=follow>relationship with Alexa Chung</a> is creating quite the buzz. However, she is not the first A-lister he has ever dated. In fact, his dating history is filled with them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3>Camilla Belle</h3><p>Sturridge was linked to Camilla Belle in the mid-2000s. They were rumored to be going out in 2006, and those rumors reportedly persisted until 2008. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their public spottings were the reason fans speculated they were together. However, the two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">always maintained</a> they were "just friends." <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h3>Carey Mulligan</h3><p>Rumors about Sturridge and <a href=# rel=follow>Carey Mulligan</a> started in October 2010. Theirs, too, was a connection made big because of public sightings, albeit just two.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The latter one came In late October 2010 as Mulligan was pictured <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leaving Chateau Marmont</a> in West Hollywood, with Sturridge following her close behind. She first got into a taxi, and the actor followed suit&nbsp;seconds later. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While in there, they both kept their heads down, not wanting to be pictured together as the cameras were everywhere.</p><p>Nothing came up about their potential romance after this, as Sturridge moved on quickly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Sienna Miller</h3><p><a href=# rel=follow>Sienna Miller</a> would be the one Sturridge would move on to after Mulligan. The former pair started their relationship in 2011. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In July&nbsp;2012, they welcomed their only child, daughter Marlowe Ottoline Layng Sturridge. And they were even set to get married — they were engaged for a while.</p><p>However, with their growing career and a growing kid to handle, their schedules got in their way. So, in 2015, they announced they had ended their engagement and went their separate ways.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two went through a rough patch, but they did not break up horribly. And even though they were not together, they did not let the separation affect their daughter one bit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>To this day, Sturridge and Miller stand as examples of how to maintain a good relationship with your ex. They are <a href=# rel="follow noopener">incredibly supportive</a> and cooperative — they even lived together for a while, shared bedtime duties, and figured out a healthy way to co-parent and share custody. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They live only a few blocks away from one another in New York,&nbsp;still accompany one another to red carpet events, and even go on double dates with their respective current partners.</p><h3>Abigail Breslin</h3><p>It is not clear exactly when, but Sturridge, upon breaking up with Miller, soon got linked with Abigail Breslin. Their dating rumors went off very quickly, though, as no follow-ups turned up regarding them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3>Juliette Buchs</h3><p>In June 2019, Sturridge was seen out and about with Juliette Buchs in New York City. According to a report and pictures from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a>, the two had lunch together and sat down at a park nearby.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>At the time of the spotting and even now, it is unknown when the two struck up a connection. However, in the pictures, they looked comfortable and casual with one another.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During their lunch in West Village, Sturridge kissed her on the cheeks, and they later took a walk, where she lit up a cigarette. However, much like the actor's previous few rumored relationships, this one, too, just fizzled out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h3>Maya Hawke</h3><p><a href=# rel=follow>Maya Hawke</a> and Sturridge first sparked dating rumors after being spotted hanging out in the Hamptons. The first pictures showed the two taking a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">casual barefoot walk</a> near the beach on July 21, 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Around a month later, they were seen engaging in some PDAs in New York City in early August 2020. This time, they were masked up and holding hands and only shared a brief kiss. But again, only silence after this.</p><h3>Alexa Chung</h3><p>Alexa Chung, Sturridge's current girlfriend, came into his life fairly recently.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Tom Sturridge with his girlfriend, Alexa Chung, in June 2022.</strong> (Photo: Alexa Chung Club/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>The couple&nbsp;first set off speculations of romance&nbsp;after attending the 2022 Glastonbury Festival.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p>Just days later, they made their relationship (kind of) official by attending Wimbledon alongside his ex, Miller. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though they are yet to make an official announcement, going by how Sturridge likes to keep things on the down low, that might never come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyfonq0wNSrqaKcl5p6pa3ToqWgZZ2WxqJ5x5qupJ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zzp4sdk1mmmct9aw4fanwlvysgh4o9bn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Shimmer and Shine Season 1 Episode 5: Abraca-Genie">&larr;
