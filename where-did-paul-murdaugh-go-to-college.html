At the time of his murder in the summer of 2021, the then 22-year-old was still a student at the University of South Carolina, and lived in an apartment near campus, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Edition</a>.</p><p>State authorities searched the dwelling for clues after Paul and his mother Maggie were slain at the Murdaugh family home.
