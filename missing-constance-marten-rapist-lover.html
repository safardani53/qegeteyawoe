newborn are <a href=#>on the run</a> with 48-year-old <a href=#>Mark Gordon </a>— a convicted rapist and armed burglar.</p><p>Raiding Constance’s multi-million- pound trust fund, they have kept one step ahead of cops by paying cash for taxis and using fake names at hotels.</p><p>But <a href=#>what they are running from</a>, and why, all remains a mystery.</p><p><a href=#>They have been missing</a> since their new car broke down and burst into flames near Junction 4 on the M61, near <a href=#>Bolton</a>, on Thursday of last week, January 5.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on Constance 'Toots' Marten">read more on Constance 'Toots' Marten</h2><p>There are suggestions their baby may have earlier been born in the vehicle — which they bought six days before their disappearance, with cash.</p><p>Police believe that, after losing their possessions in the blaze, Constance and Gordon walked with her baby to a nearby junction and flagged down a taxi to <a href=#>Liverpool</a>.</p><h2>Tortoise tattoo</h2><p>In the early hours of the next day, at about 3.30am, they gave another driver a bundle of cash to take them more than 250 miles to Harwich, <a href=#>Essex</a>, where they were believed to be looking to quit the country by ferry.</p><p>Constance was seen cradling her child under a big red shawl but there is no evidence they ever departed for the Continent.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>They were also spotted in Colchester, Essex, where police visited “every hotel and bed and breakfast” in a bid to find them.</p><p>The latest confirmed sighting was then in <a href=#>East London</a> last Saturday, January 7, after they took a taxi to East Ham Tube station.</p><p><a href=#>CCTV footage</a> showed them on a platform using hats and scarves to hide their faces.</p><p>They clearly do not want to be found.</p><p>Det Supt Lewis Basford, leading the <a href=#>Met Police</a>’s inquiries, said: “As far as we are aware, neither Constance nor the baby have received medical attention since it was born.</p><p>"Our priority is to ensure the baby, and Constance and Mark, are safe and well.”</p><p>So how did a blue-blooded society heiress become involved with a sex offender who served two decades behind bars?</p><p>Born into wealth and privilege in 1987, Constance is the eldest child of film and music producer Napier and psychotherapist Virginie.</p><p>The family seat was 18th-century pile <a href=#>Crichel House</a> — set in 5,000 acres of <a href=#>Dorset</a> parkland complete with 50 cottages, four villages, a cricket club and an ornamental lake.</p><p>It featured in Holly-wood star <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow’</a>s 1996 period rom-com Emma, based on Jane Austen same-titled novel.</p><p>Constance’s grandmother, Mary Anna Marten, was a British Museum trustee whose godmother was the late <a href=#>Queen Mother</a>.</p><img

href=#>Royal Navy</a>.</p><p>But in 1996, when Constance was just nine, her father did his own disappearing act.</p><p>He renounced his £115million inheritance for a life in <a href=#>Australia</a> centred on whale-watching and spiritual discovery,</p><p>Napier said later: “Even with small children, I had to leave the house and go pretty much overnight.”</p><p>He added that, despite “great privilege”, he felt his life was “an empty shell”.</p><p>He first flew to <a href=#>Hawaiian</a> island Maui — where he shaved his head as “two fingers” to his old life.</p><p>An encounter with whales made him cry “almost non-stop” for a week, and in Australia he had an out-of-body experience with some indigenous people on a clifftop.</p><p>He later returned but the family seat passed to his eldest son, Maximillian, now 34.</p><p>In 2013, Crichel House was sold to a US hedge-fund billionaire for £34million.</p><p>Known to pals as Toots, Constance attended the £30,000-a-year former St Mary’s Roman Catholic boarding school for girls, near Shaftesbury.</p><p>She seems to have always been one of life’s rebels.</p><p>In 2016, she posted a school photo on <a href=#>Facebook</a> showing her pulling a face as more demure classmates looked on.</p><p>She captioned it: “Mrs McSiggan said she was going to edit my face out and charge my mother for the editing! Furious!”</p><p>She also shared on Facebook an image of her as a curly-haired kid with her mother — and a goose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/couple-missing-week-newborn-baby-788177037-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/36fcb4e9-a793-4eea-ae8a-e029aa16579d.jpg><p>She wrote: “Those were the days of naked picnics, siestas amid hay bales, and tractor scoops. “</p><p>At Leeds University, she studied Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies, during which time she spent a year in <a href=#>Egyptian</a> capital Cairo.</p><p>Her social media accounts reveal glamourous time in Swiss ski resort Verbier and Washington DC.</p><p>Society bible Tatler named her in January 2009 as its Babe of the Month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/8c6c146e-a83f-4cd4-b39d-455a369275d2.jpg><p>In an interview with the magazine, she said cider was “one of her five-a-day” — and that she wanted to get a tortoise tattooed on her foot.</p><p>She also revealed the best party she had ever been to was at Viscount Cranborne’s pile in Dorset.</p><p>She said: “There was a gambling tent, and grapes hanging from the walls.</p><p>"It was like a debauched feast from ancient <a href=#>Greece</a>.”</p><p>After university she worked as a researcher for Arabic TV network Al Jazeera and took a course in journalism.</p><p>Then she enrolled on an acting course at East 15 drama school in Essex.</p><h2>False names</h2><p>Classmates there say she paid for the course from her trust fund, and was popular.</p><p>One said: “She was just beautiful, full of life, full of kindness — and very, very talented.”</p><p>But by 2016, they had noticed a change in her.</p><p>She quit the course and began a supposedly stormy relationship with a man they had never met.</p><p>It was around then she had begun dating Gordon.</p><p>His life is less well charted than hers but he was born in Birmingham and moved to the US as a child, with mum Sylvia and half-siblings.</p><p>Now a registered sex offender, he was jailed in the late Eighties in <a href=#>Florida</a> after raping and assaulting a woman in her early twenties when he was 14.</p><p>He was convicted at 16 and served 20 years before being deported to the UK in 2010.</p><p>He then lived in a ramshackle terraced home in Enfield, North London, opposite an off-licence.</p><p>It is not known how he met drama student Constance but they moved in together in Ilford, East London, as she shut out her old life.</p><p>Her Facebook and <a href=#>Instagram</a> were not updated from 2016.</p><p>She seemed to have fallen off the Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/talented-mum-missing-mum-constance-788721952-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2aynfbh-aerial-view-crichel-house-789598484.jpg><p>But in early 2000, she broke cover with Facebook shots of her cradling a baby that seemed to be hers.</p><p>Other shots — labelled “My love sprogs” — suggest she maybe had more kids.</p><p>The posts drew comments.
