<span>on September 8, 1992, </span><span>in Chur, Switzerland.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Nino grew up alongside his two sisters, whose names remain hidden from the media’s eyes.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nino-Niederreiter-father.jpg><p>Unfortunately, there is not much detail about the 27-year-old’s childhood or educational background.</p><p>Nevertheless, we did find out that Niederreiter played in the youth team of the Swiss team HC Davos, which is one of the elite teams in the National League of Switzerland.</p><p>In fact, Nino even made three playoff appearances for the senior side in 2010.</p><h2>Nino Niederreiter: Career & Stats</h2><p>Niederreiter was regarded as one of the top players coming out of Europe in 2009.</p><p>Thus, it would have been easy for the Swiss international to declare his eligibility in the NHL and subsequently play in the most lucrative and competitive ice hockey league in the world.</p><p>However, Nino knew that he still needed some time to adapt and develop to be a top player in the NHL.</p><p>Consequently, the 27-year-old decided to play in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Western Hockey League</a> (WHL), which acts as a feeder league to the NHL.</p><p>Thereafter, Niederreiter was drafted by the Portland Winterhawks in 2009, where he enjoyed an outstanding debut season.</p><p>To emphasize, the rookie led his team in scoring with 36 goals in the regular season.</p><p>Furthermore, he ended the season with 78 appearances in which he scored 44 goals, 76 points, and provided 32 assists.</p><p>Thus, having had a breakthrough first season in North America, many top analysts predicted that Nino would be only the fourth Swiss player to be picked in the first round.</p><p>In fact, one of the top NHL analysts, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Mckenzie</a>, even said that the 27-year-old had the talent to become the highest-picked Swiss player ever.</p><h3>New York Islanders</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nino-niederreiter-New-York-Islanders-1024x683.jpg><p>Nino enjoyed a glorious season in the WHL with the Portland Winterhawks. Thus, everyone knew that he would be picked very high in the first round.</p><p>Subsequently, on draft day, to nobody’s surprise, New York Islanders drafted Niederreiter as the fifth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.</p><p>Soon after, the Chur native signed a three-year entry-level contract and debuted on October 9, 2010.</p><p>In doing so, Nino became the youngest player in Islanders’ history to appear in an NHL game.</p><p>Four days later, the Swiss right winger scored his first goal against Washington Capitals.</p><p>Consequently, Niederreiter became the youngest player in the franchise’s history to score a goal at just 18 years and 32 days.</p><p>Although Nino’s undoubted quality was there for all to see, Islanders felt that he needed some more development time before throwing him into the deep end.</p><p>Thus, having only played in nine games during the 2010-11 season, Niederreiter returned to his former team, Portland Winterhawks, for the rest of the season.</p><p>Subsequently, Nino had one of the best years of his career as he scored 50 goals, 97 points, and 38 assists in 76 appearances for the team.</p><p>As a result, New York Islanders called him back to their roster for the 2011-12 season.</p><p>While most of the pundits backed the Swiss international to live up to his hype, Niederreiter finally had the worst season of his career.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Devon Toews Bio: Salary, Siblings, Career, CapFriendly, Contract Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>To explain, the 6 foot 2 right winger played in 55 games, managing an astoundingly disappointing solitary goal and assist.</p><p>Consequently, Islanders loaned Nino to WHL’s Bridgeport Sound Tigers at the end of the 2011-12 season.</p><p>After that, the 27-year-old spent the 2012-13 season regaining his form as he managed 74 appearances scoring 28 goals and 50 points along with 22 assists.</p><p>After having three unsuccessful years with New York Islanders, both parties decided that a trade would be in their best interest.</p><p>Consequently, on June 30, 2013, the Islanders traded Nino to the Minnesota Wild for Cal Clutterbuck and the third-round pick in the 2013 draft.</p><p></p><p>Upon signing with Wild, the curse on Niederreiter finally lifted as he managed career highs in all departments at that time.</p><p>To explain, the 27-year-old played in 94 games in which he scored 17 goals, and 42 points and provided a further 25 assists.</p><p>Also, Nino made the first appearance of his career in the NHL playoffs.</p><p>Thereafter, the 6 foot 2 right winger stayed with the franchise for another five years, reaching the playoffs four times.</p><p>Nino’s performances were so impressive that Wild handed him a five-year $26.5 million contract in 2017.</p><p>However, due to various reasons, the Swiss international got traded to his current employer, Carolina Hurricanes.</p><p>Since then, Niederreiter has not played that much for the Hurricanes, mainly because of his injuries.</p><p>The world pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19) has resulted in the league being postponed.</p><p>Thus, we would like to wish Nino good health and a fast recovery so that when the league resumes, he can be in his best form.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Moving on to his international career, Nino has played for Switzerland at various levels and tournaments.</p><p>To illustrate, the 27-year-old has 25 junior team appearances for Switzerland at the IIHF U-18 World&nbsp; Championship and the World Junior Championships, scoring 10 goals and 22 points along with 10 assists.</p><p>And, about his senior team appearances, Niederreiter has played 49 times and scored 13 goals, 26 points, and 13 assists to date.</p><p>Likewise, during that time, the Swiss international won two silver medals at World Championships in 2013 and 2018.</p><h2>How old is Nino Niederreiter?
