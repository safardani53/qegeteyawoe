Because of that, 22 momme is generally thought of as the perfect balance between weight and quality.</p><p>We thought this mask looked and felt lovely and luxurious and, because it came in a gift box, would make a lovely present for someone.</p><p>It's also available in a few different colours so it's easy to find a shade that suits you.</p><p>The oversized design meant that it completely blocked out the light without putting any pressure on our skin.</p><p>However, because the fabric is so soft and silky, the mask does slip off by the morning.</p><p>It’s not a big problem if your bedroom is dark or you’re a heavy sleeper but otherwise you may find yourself waking up before your alarm goes off in the morning.</p><h2>We tested: Echor Total Blackout eye mask</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5c5aa629-cfa6-42f7-83a3-809af14653c0_1800x1800.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Echor Total Blackout eye mask, £17.99 from Echor - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Echor Total Blackout eye mask is one of the bulkier designs we tested but it could be just right for those with false eyelashes or are having a nap during the day.</p><p>The side touching the face is padded with soft foam that raises the eye mask away from your eyes.</p><p>It means there’s zero rub on your eyelids, which should keep any lashes or eye makeup intact.</p><p>The design also features extra flaps around the nose that ensure maximum light blocking and we found it’s effective for different sized noses as well.</p><p>And unlike most eye masks, the strap on this one is adjustable so it’s easy to find a comfortable fit.</p><p>That said, it’s not one we would recommend to side sleepers - the foam padding means the eye mask is raised on all sides and you can definitely feel it pressing into your face when you’re lying on your side.</p><h2>We tested: HoMedics travel eye mask with built-in headphones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/apiuypg0y__35125.1616688566.jpg><ul><li><strong>HoMedics travel eye mask, £17.99 from Homedics - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The HoMedics travel eye mask has a few different features built into one accessory.</p><p>As well as being a blackout eye mask, it’s fitted with a mini battery-powered motor that gently vibrates when it’s on to give you a head massage.</p><p>It also features built-in headphones - a cable is provided - so you can listen to music or a podcast.</p><p>And as the straps are made from velcro, it’s easy to adjust the size to suit you.</p><p>This is definitely the largest and bulkiest eye mask we tried and we found that it was quite awkward to put on, especially when it came to positioning the headphones in the right place.</p><p>Once it’s on, it does fit pretty snugly and the moleskin-style fabric was really soft to the touch.</p><p>We found this eye mask quite relaxing for meditation - it blocks out all the light and the headphones create a surround sound feel - but we think it’s a bit too bulky to sleep on comfortably.</p><h2><b>Soap & Glory The Rest Assured sleep mask</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dk-image-sleepmasks4-e1567776944827.jpg><ul><li><b>Soap & Glory The Rest Assured sleep mask, £6.50 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></b></li></ul><p>Your eyes are working constantly, so give them the love they're entitled to with this cooling gel eye mask from Soap & Glory.</p><p>Straight from the fridge, it’ll soothe your eyes immediately.</p><p>The gel mask is detachable with its own elastic strap, so you can wear it separately if you wish. Just make sure you wash it well in between uses.</p><h2>Slip Silk sleep mask</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dk-image-sleepmasks3-e1548665761264.jpg><ul><li><b>Slip Silk sleep mask, £50 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></b></li></ul><p>For an alternatively silk sleep mask, try this one from SlipSilk.</p><p>Crafted from high quality 22 momme mulberry silk, this baby pink sleep mask is lustrous and soft but also durable.</p><p>You can also get it in a few other shades.</p><p>It's baggy but not oversized, so would work if you have a smaller face.</p><h2><strong>How often should I use eye masks?</strong></h2><p>You can use your eye mask as often as you need - just make sure they're washed regularly if you're using them every night.</p><p>Ideally, they should be cleaned at least weekly - see below.</p><h2>Can you wash eye masks?</h2><p>Anything that comes in regular contact with your skin needs to be washed frequently.</p><p>Just like you'd wash your pillowcases and clothes, you need to keep your eye mask germ free.</p><p>Most of the time you can machine wash your eye mask with the rest of your load, but double-check the washing instructions before you chuck it in.</p><p>Many sleep masks are made of silk, which you'll need to hand wash in cold water with a gentle soap and line dry.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS FASHION</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best eye masks for sleeping?
