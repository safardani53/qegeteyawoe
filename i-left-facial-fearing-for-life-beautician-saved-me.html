As soon as she saw it, she said I need to get it looked at as soon as possible.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more real life health stories">Read more real life health stories</h2><p>"Prior to that, about six months before, I saw another doctor and they told me to put a cream on it and said nothing to worry about, it's fine."</p><p>The mum-of-one, who owns a childcare centre with husband Paul, 58, immediately made an appointment with a skin specialist.</p><p>After doctors took a biopsy, which tests for cancerous cells, Jillian was stunned to be given a devastating diagnosis.</p><p>Jillian had stage two <a href=#>melanoma</a> above her right breast and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on her nose.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health News</h2></p><p>While BCCs are typically slow-growing and almost never spread to other parts of the body, melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer.</p><p>Both forms are almost always the result of sun exposure, and Australia has the highest rates of skin cancer globally.</p><p>Melanoma can present as a asymmetrial mole, have a ragged border, mixture of colours and is usually larger than 6mm.</p><p>Meanwhile, a BCC usually looks like a slightly transparent, shiny pink or pearly-white bump on the skin, and it may become crusty or bleed.</p><p>Jillian said: "I went to a skin cancer doctor and he didn't hesitate to take a biopsy.&nbsp;</p><p>“I found out it was cancerous four days later and they didn't muck around.</p><p>"I had two major operations in less than three weeks.</p><p>"When I found out it was cancerous, I was a mess, shaking, I couldn't comprehend, I thought my life was over, thought it would be in the blood system.</p><p>"I didn't know the extent of how horrific it was. It was really bad. If it gets in your bloodstream, it's bad.”</p><p>Jillian had an operation in November but had to go under the knife again in December to prevent the cancer spreading into her lymph nodes.</p><p>Doctors had to go four centimetres deep to remove the cancer.</p><p>Jillian said: “I was in overnight for the first one but they didn't get all the melanoma so we had to wait two weeks then they had to go in deeper.</p><p>"I was in ridiculous pain. I was cut very, very deep and I still don't have feeling in my right breast or chest.</p><p>"I was just outside of the margin [of the cancer spreading] so they didn't have to take my lymph nodes out and I have to be checked out every three months.”</p><p>Jillian says she “looked disgusting” after her ops.</p><p>“But I'm healing now and my doctor can't believe how well I'm healing because I'm using vitamin B,” she said.</p><p>“My face is good but make up covers it, my chest is pretty bad. I'm still scarred and I will be forever."</p><p>Jillian praises Leigh for saving her life and the pair have formed a friendship as the beautician has supported her throughout her recovery.</p><p>She said: "It's amazing for a beautician to find it when a doctor missed it first. She's worth her weight in gold. She's bloody ace.</p><p>"I'm a very lucky lady. Without her expertise I wouldn't be here and my doctor said I won the lotto with her.</p><p>"When I tell her she's saved my life, she gets goosebumps, she's overwhelmed and she's so pleased that her training has taught her what to do.</p><p>"I've been seeing Leigh for a few years. She went over me like a fine-tooth comb.</p><p>"I brag about her and tell people to go and see her because she does her job and she's very caring. She's very professional. I've probably sent a good few people to her.</p><p>"My family are so grateful for Leigh."</p><p>Leigh, who is helping to improve Jillian’s scarring, said: "I’m so happy I was able to help my friend as the oncologist advised that if it was left any longer it would’ve gone into her lymph nodes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"I use an Asap SkinCare in my salon and a Super B serum that has been amazing on Jillian’s scars.&nbsp;</p><p>“In April, I will start to do some radio frequency micro-needling treatments."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000722714946.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000722714388.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIJxfJhpbWxnmWK5prLTZp2am5mWuW6yxJqpoqaXYrOwvoyloJ%2BdXZeyosHTopqimZ5iwKLCxJ1kpp1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dino-danelli.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dino Danelli">&larr;
