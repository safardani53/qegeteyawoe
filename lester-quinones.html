He has a white ethnical background. And many gaming scenarios in his life started in grade six.</p><p>It was the early workout with his dad that brewed the storm of basketball in his heart. He would highly credit the activity.</p><p>As a kid, Lester always dreamed of being a pro, being a qualified player in the NBA, working, achieving, and grinding on the court.</p><p>And luckily, he always had his parent’s support by his side. Talking about his birthplace, he claimed there is a lot of basketball in Brentwood.</p><p>Whether indoors or outdoors, everybody wants to have a ball in their hands; they dream of playing in the NBA every day.</p><p>Lester is of Dominican descent, and the Dominican culture has adapted lately to this basketball trend.</p><p>Guys like <a href=# rel=noopener>Al Horford</a> (Boston Celtics) and Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves) have made it big here in the NBA, marking their hometown territory.</p><p>Yes, people from Dominican culture also can make it huge.</p><h2>Lester Quinones | High School Career</h2><p>Well, Lester enrolled at Brentwood High School and completed the first two years of high school.</p><p>He then switched to &nbsp;Upper Room Christian, a private school in Dix Hills, New York, where he notched 19.3 points per game as a junior.</p><p>When asked about his time with Upper Room Christian, he realized he had to face many more challenges.</p><p>He has to work more and grind more to survive the struggle. However, Lester was also titled to the &nbsp;2017 Long Island Basketball honor roll.</p><p>For his last year of high school, Lester moved to St. Benedict’s Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>He was a definite powerhouse for the team and a capable opponent threat. He almost notched &nbsp;16.7 points and four rebounds for the Gray Bees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lester-Quinones-4-300x200.jpg><p>Not to mention, St Benedict ranked no. Three high schools in the country. He remained a teammate with five-star recruit Precious Achiuwa.</p><p>Lester led his team to win over Hudson Catholic Regional High School with a game-high 23 points.</p><p>Hudson was listed as the number one team on NJ.com’s Top 20 poll. The team also made it to the top 10 national rankings by Maxpreps.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, he also ventured for New Heights and Precious Achiuwa, again scoring 15.2 points and 4.7 rebounds on the Under Armour Association (UAA) circuit.</p><p>You can find the latest rankings, snapshots, and much more information about Lester on the <a href=#>Rivals website</a>.</p><h3>IMG Academy</h3><p>For his post-graduation, Lester attended IMG Academy, and there he managed to excel at every game.</p><p>It was all about working out every day, lifting every day, running every day, and getting his body into the utmost fittest shape every day.</p><p>He managed to bring a substantial drastic change there, and yes, he established there as a most featured player.</p><p>Lester scored 24 points, nine rebounds, and six assists with a 38 percent shoot on three-pointers to talk his scoring.</p><h2>Lester Quinones | High School Stats</h2><table class="wikitable sortable jquery-tablesorter"><tr></tr><tbody><tr><td>2019–20</td><td>Memphis</td><td>26</td><td>23</td><td>29.4</td><td>.402</td><td>.313</td><td>.804</td><td>3.8</td><td>2<strong>.2</strong></td><td>.8</td><td>.1</td><td>10.7</td></tr><tr><td>2020–21</td><td>Memphis</td><td>28</td><td>28</td><td>26.3</td><td>.432</td><td>.400</td><td>.672</td><td>5.8</td><td>1.9</td><td>.9</td><td>.2</td><td>9.5</td></tr><tr class=sortbottom><td colspan=2>Career</td><td>54</td><td>51</td><td>27.8</td><td>.418</td><td>.356</td><td>.753</td><td>4.9</td><td>2.0</td><td>.8</td><td>.1</td><td>10.1</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Lester Quinones | Recruiting</h2><p>He landed as a consensus four-star recruit from high school and postgraduate.</p><p>Later on May 10, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Memphis under head coach Penny Hardaway.</p><p>Quinones had a handful of opportunities from Arizona, Florida, Florida, Georgia Tech, Illinois, LSU, Maryland, Ohio State, Providence, Saint Louis, Seton Hall, UConn, and West Virginia Xavier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lester-Quinones-3-282x300.jpg><p>Quinones was added as the ninth-ranked shooting guard in the nation to the 2019 recruiting class.</p><p>They required a shooter, and as a matter of fact, the way Lester picked and rolled caught their eyes.</p><p>In late 2019, Lester faced two broken bones in his shooting (right) hand in a game against Ole Miss, which they won.</p><p>His hand got seized in KJ Buffon’s jersey and poorly twisted while he was extending his arms to guard Austin Crowley. As a result, he was sidelined for 21 days.</p><p>After his hand injury, Lester was back working with assistant coach Cody Toppert on August 6, 2020.</p><p>Well, coach Cody was quite happy about seeing a hard-working player hopping back again in the game.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to check out:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>&lt;&lt;Sam Mills Bio: Early Life, Professional Career, NFL & Cancer >></strong></a></p><h3>Under the limelight because of his short shorts</h3><p>Well, people who have seen him playing must have addressed his shorts, which are too short. Ever gave it a thought; why does this guard wear his shorts too short? Here’s the answer.</p><p>The Memphis Guard, Lester Quinones, has gathered much of the highlights because of his out-of-the-box sense of style.</p><p>Lester’s attire made a lot of buzz in the town as the topic expanded in the google trend. Even above the great players like Precious Achiuwa and James Wiseman.</p><p>Even his head coach at Memphis, Penny Hardaway, had to smile and save his team from negativity.</p><p>His thoughts on Lester’s shorts were clear. As per the head coach, love them or hate them; shorts are simple. He wants to define his era with the shorts he wears.</p><p>Lester wore those shorts since his IMG days. He used to roll the shorts and tuck them into his compression undershorts.</p><p>So the rolled part does not fall. It was his style. However, his teammates were still confused about his wardrobe choice.</p><p>Let’s hear what Lester feels about the shorts. During one of the interviews with Memphis Commercial Appeal, he mentioned it saying,</p><p>“It is just my kind of thing, and it is just me. It is different. We need some more shorts in basketball; it is a great quote that should not be changed.”</p><h2>Lester Quinones | Personal Life</h2><p>After his short shorts, the most apparel question that must have filled the google search feed is his relationship status.</p><p>He has become Memphis’s heartthrob but recently became a fan favorite.</p><p>Keeping all your curiosities in mind, we scanned over all the internet pages on his relationship status, but sadly, we cannot conclude.</p><p>And this probably indicates that Lester is single and must focus on his career for the time being.</p><p>And that’s okay; being serious and prudent towards your passion, future, and career is not wrong.</p><p>As mentioned above, he is designing his life the way he dreamed. Moreover, his versatility is his strong point.</p><p>He can do everything equally, shoot, pass, rebound, defend. But as of now, he wants to get better at handling traps and pressure off the ball screen.</p><p>Keeping the talk of his relationship status aside, Lester is more of a family guy. His parents mean a lot to him, and nothing is more important than his parents.</p><h2>Lester Quinones | Net Worth</h2><p>Lester is still running with his collegiate career, which directly indicates he has not joined anywhere professionally.</p><p>He is a promising player with some versatile capacity and explicit talent. He will surely make it to the NBA, and once he is there, he will be unstoppable.</p><p>And why not? Lester was busy improving his game and play style when everybody else was partying and chilling in Brentwood.</p><p>Not to mention, Lester also receives compensation after joining Memphis to cover his tuition fees and other expenses, including housing facilities.</p><p><strong>You can also read about yet another college basketball player:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;Jaden Springer Bio: Early Life, College, Girlfriend & Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p>Moving on to his social media presence, Lester is available on Twitter and Instagram.
