As one of the OGs of the “clean beauty” movement, she created a line of beauty products that help skin and hair without these questionable ingredients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NYU Langone dermatological surgeon Mary L. Stevenson, MD, tells PEOPLE the most important ingredients you can look for in skincare are “SPF, retinols or retinoids, and DNA-damage and repair factors like growth hormones and peptides.” She says SPF ranks supreme, while the retinoids prevent fine links and the repair factors help with damaged skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All of these ingredients can be found in Drunk Elephant products which are known for their skin-first methods (rather than focusing on fragrance, feel, etc.). The brand also has many celebrity fans like Vanessa Hudgens who swears by the Beste Jelly Cleanser and Alix Earle who uses the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops</a>. Plus, with more bestsellers dropping throughout the year, there’s no shortage of great Drunk Elephant products to choose from.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Masterson started selling skincare for Arbonne and began with a bar cleanser that she sold around her hometown of Houston to friends and family members. That experience sparked her passion for products and ingredients. She began questioning what was in an ingredient deck, how certain ingredients affect the skin, and how the skin functions. “I started identifying common threads and ingredients that were in every product I saw,” said Masterson. “And a light bulb went off one day, and I thought, Wow, you know, you could target any issue you wanted, but if a product contains these ingredients, then you're either going to make the issue worse or just not help it at all.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In 2012, Masterson created a line of products to help troubleshoot skincare issues, giving the skin a reset from these common ingredients, and bringing together the world of natural and clinical skincare. “'Clean' was not a word that was used at all back then in beauty, and when I got my products into Sephora, they asked me to describe my brand in three words," says Masterson. She decided on “clean, clinical, and compatible,” meaning your skin can absorb and benefit from the ingredients. “There was a lack of products on the market that fit into this philosophy I was forming, so I made them," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Drunk Elephant was sold to skincare brand Shiseido three years ago, however she remains an integral part of the business. “As a founder, I’m as involved as ever before," says Masterson. "Our mission has remained the same.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This popular brand has many incredible products, but we’ve narrowed the list to our 13 favorites for skin, body, and hair.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-virgin-marula-luxury-facial-oil></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xMoZR_ze0qmpEaTlpfV0_MDW9Ng=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ashoe9-a4d5185fa6414c99b861ea67a09536ee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>It strengthens and smooths the skin barrier.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Leaves you skin feeling soft and with a subtle glow.</p></li><li readability=1><p>According to the founder, it won’t break you out, despite being an oil.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Virgin Marula was among the first six products I made, and it’s an ingredient I believe very strongly in due to its benefits for skin,” says Masterson. “It has anti-inflammatory, barrier reparative and free-radical defense abilities, and it works for all skin.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll find marula oil in most Drunk Elephant products — and ironically as the source of the name, which comes from the idea that elephants become intoxicated after eating marula fruit (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>mostly a myth</a>, but a fun anecdote nonetheless!). Masterson assures us that “it won’t break you out, and can be used on acne-prone skin as well. It’s very nutrient dense, [and] just helps balance skin.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This facial oil is highly concentrated, and can be applied via Drunk Elephant’s smoothie method (combining it in your hands with other products and blending them together before applying to your face!). “Drunk Elephant uses a proprietary extraction and filtration process, resulting in the purest and most concentrated form of the oil, with its delicate antioxidant and fatty acid compounds preserved,” says Masterson. Its high concentration of these ingredients (testing showed higher levels of “polyphenols than dark chocolate, green or black teas”) helps it absorb into the skin, strengthen and smooth its barrier, and leaves your skin feeling soft and glowy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.5 oz., 1 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredient:</strong> Marula oil, glycerin, vitamin E, zinc oxide, tocopherol</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-c-firma-fresh-vitamin-c-day-serum></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant C-Firma Fresh Vitamin C Day Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drunk Elephant C-Firma Fresh Day Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/uKngOc_zCPBKBc082QSgYofKgAs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drunk-elephant-c-firma-fresh-day-serum-1233eca9471e4f7ca2db6edf8616ce82.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>The vitamin C component reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and smooths out skin texture.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Extended shelf life due to the unique design of not allowing oxygen to reach the product until it’s being used.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Vitamin C serums</a> have been known to help restore facial texture, remove fine lines and wrinkles, and smooth out skin, and this one is packed with it.

With the user shaking it upon activation, the formula never touches the air and has a shelf-life of one year after first use, and three years prior to activation. With fruit enzymes that digest dead skin cells, this serum absorbs into your skin beautifully. “Vitamin C is supposed to be sticky, [and this formula] is sticky, but that’s how you know it’s the real deal,” says Masterson. “And you can mix it into your “smoothies” with other moisturizers or the oil and that stickiness goes right away.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.94 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredient:</strong> Vitamin C, pumpkin ferment, pomegranate extract, chronocylclin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-protini-polypeptide-cream></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Drunk-elephant-protini-polypeptide-cream style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/h4Gfv2bB3o6zAp2hzZKDk5fVabw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drunk-elephant-protini-polypeptide-cream-8e1d837699b34c318b88f45f3dbff7dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>It contains a high number of peptides and a safe synthetic growth factor which results in a highly moisturizing formula.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The formula also easily absorbs into the skin.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most popular products from this brand came from Masterson's mother’s complaint — how apropos. “I developed [Protini Polypeptide Cream] on an airplane,” Masterson says. “My mom said, ‘You know if you don’t get something with growth factors and things to help my collagen, I’m going to use another brand.'” Masterson says she spent the rest of the flight researching ingredients that maintain and create collagen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She found incredible ingredients, but “where one works, five is better.” Her philosophy is that the supporting ingredients are just as essential as the key ones. “So if you have an ingredient like a peptide, there’s always ingredients that can support and make that ingredient better,” she says. “[This cream] has the highest level of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>peptides</a>, [and] a safe synthetic growth factor in it.” It’s highly moisturizing, and as a bioavailable product, it absorbs easily in the skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.17 oz., 0.5 oz., 1.69 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredient:</strong> Peptides, glycerin, marula oil, zinc oxide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-a-passioni-retinol-cream></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant A-Passioni Retinol Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Drunk Elephant A-Passioni Retinol Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5jeRy92Ut0tW7_pHVfBC0SUVgaI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/a-passioni-retinol-cream-fa699b44717b4e0eaf3c27faac152600.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>Retinol helps with acne, age spots, and fine lines.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This formula functions equally well for youthful and mature skin.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Retinol truly is a “do-it-all ingredient” and Masterson believes “it should be in everyone’s routine.” It can help with acne, age spots, fine lines, and is suitable for young and more mature skin. “It teaches your skin cells to behave better,” says Masterson. However, many are wary of retinol because it’s so strong and with a concentration of one percent, this cream lives up to that reputation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It doesn’t have silicones so you’re getting a full hit of retinol,” Masterson says. She tackles some myths about retinol saying, “People think you can’t use it during the day. You can. People think their skin can’t tolerate retinol when it starts to peel and turn red so they stop using it all together.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She emphasizes building up a tolerance to this ingredient rather than stopping use at the first sign of irritation. “If you turn red and flaky, that’s not good. It’s not an exfoliating product, it speeds up cell turnover. It’s not supposed to make your skin peel off,” she says. But instead of rushing to drop the product completely, Masterson suggests slowing down your use. “Start once a week, and build up as your skin allows you to.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who want a gentler alternative to start, Drunk Elephant also offers <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">A-Gloei Maretinol Oil</a> —&nbsp;a blend of A-Passioni and marula oil which acts as a gateway product to introduce your skin to retinol. Ironically, it was Masterson’s son who came up with the idea when she suggested he combine these products before going straight to the cream, and he suggested she make a product that had both so he didn’t have to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.34 oz., 1 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> 1% retinol, glycerin, jojoba, marula oil, zinc oxide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-beste-no9-jelly-cleanser></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Beste No.9 Jelly Cleanser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XprxdXNlEpHCEmEzUyP1otP_3FQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beste-no-9-jelly-cleanser-d8c0d89b465f45eab2fda66d8ffeb9f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>Simple formula that removes bacteria, dirt, and pollution from your skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It doesn’t strip or compromise the skin barrier</p></li><li readability=0><p>It won’t leave your skin squeaky clean, which is a good thing (more on that below!)</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If at first you don’t succeed, try eight more times. That’s what Drunk Elephant had to do with this (finally!) effective cleanser. Masterson says a retailer had asked the brand for a gel cleanser, and in order to meet demand they rushed through its conception — and it didn’t work. “It was bad packaging, a bad formulation, and [ultimately] a learning lesson,” she says, noting that she took to Instagram to publicly own up to the error here. Nine attempts later, they finally had a formula Masterson was happy with, so in the spirit of transparency, they called it Beste No. 9.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Beste is a deceptively simple formula—it was our first liquid cleanser after our solid bars, and we wanted something that would easily remove the bacteria, dirt and pollution from the day, but still not strip skin or compromise the balance of lipids and emollients in its barrier,” Masterson says. This incredibly mild formula has plant-based cleaning agents called surfactants that have low pH levels, but are still effective at removing makeup. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Even Vanessa Hudgens is a fan</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Beste won’t leave your skin feeling squeaky clean, but that’s actually a good thing,” says Masterson. The founder explains that “alkaline surfactant systems used in classic foaming cleansers” are really harsh on skin, which is where their trademark ‘squeaky clean’ feeling comes from. “It’s literally the feel of a skin barrier that has had its superficial lipids stripped away.” Beste completely rinses off from the skin without leaving any residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Plant-derived cleaning agents, oils, acids, and fats, glycerin, cantaloupe fruit extract, virgin marula oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-f-balm-electrolyte-waterfacial-mask></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant F-Balm Waterfacial Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Drunk Elephant F-Balm&amp;acirc;&amp;cent; Electrolyte Waterfacial Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MKJFIYogKMrMEyfPwXTNw7FNY6k=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Drunk-Elephant-F-Balm-Electrolyte-Waterfacial-Mask-497cb919121e4673bd9dc05e504b69aa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Made with small biodegradable beads that burst to release vitamin F and coconut water into your skin.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It keeps your skin ultra soft by boosting your natural oils and fats.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Electrolytes help retain moisture and calm inflammation in your skin.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a complete hydration experience, look no further than this waterfacial mask —&nbsp;after all, the queen of dewy skin, Hailey Bieber has posted on her Instagram story that she uses it too. The F-Balm Electrolyte mask doesn’t get enough attention for how effective it is, says Masterson. This is "the mother of hydration” and “has these little beads that are biodegradable,” she says. The beads burst when used and are filled with vitamin F and a blend of coconut water, sodium PCA, magnesium PCA, and prickly pear extract.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Electrolytes help retain moisture in the skin and calm inflammation. Also packed into these F-Balms is linolenic acid (vitamin F) which boosts skin function. These ingredients work to make your natural oils and fats more effective, and thus keep skin soft. The mask feels amazing in all seasons, but especially when facing the drier climates and colder times of year. “[It’s] intensely hydrating when skin is dehydrated, stressed, or irritated,” Masterson says. “I’m so in love with it. I use it every morning and night.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 1.69 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Four-Electrolyte Blend, vitamin F, niacinamide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-slaai-makeup-melting-butter-cleanser></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Drunk Elephant Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/TyZEHILqJQxAmUDnDiSrODwOY1U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Drunk-Elephant-Slaai-Makeup-Melting-Butter-Cleanser--b5f24c3db2c44f958c0bc6bbbe949340.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>Plant-based cleanser that gently removes makeup, sunscreen, and other residue</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Gentle formula is good for even sensitive skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another favorite of Bieber’s, this butter cleanser is made with rich botanical extracts, and easily removes the day from your face while soothing your skin in the process. “It’s easy on the eyes and doesn’t sting,” says Masterson. “Slaai was our first oil-based cleansing formula, using a blend of plant oils and our mildest blend of surfactants (so gentle they can be used on the eye area, by even the most sensitive of skin) to melt away sunscreen, makeup (even water-resistant forms), dirt, and pollution.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The key to application is keeping your hands and face dry. “While Slaai is dry, it is doing its work to emulsify and remove substances from skin,” says Masterson. “When you add water, Slaai transforms from a balm to a milk as it dissolves and rinses away (at which point it is no longer cleansing skin). This is why it is crucial to use Slaai dry and on dry skin — any water at all stops the cleansing process and starts the melting process.” It’s suggested to place it in your hands and warm it up to “melt” the butter before applying it to your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As an added bonus, each Slaai cleanser comes with a Bamboo Booster — a fine powder made from bamboo and charcoal.

When you put it on it feels like vaseline, but then you wake up and it’s gone and your skin is clearly plump, glowing, and nourished.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, most of the ingredients are sustainably sourced, and trade agreements are in place to support the farming communities they come from. This recent launch has the founder excited about its future. “It’s one of those products that as time goes on it’ll grow and people will find different uses for it,” she says. “I can’t sing its praises enough.

This formula is made without “silicones, harsh sulfates, essential oils, and fragrance,” so it’s just working to restore your scalp and hair health without all the gimmicks. “Hair is dead,” Masterson says. “So all we can hope for is to get it nourished and [to] absorb the moisture we’re trying to get into it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The trick is to do this without stripping away natural oils, which a lot of the ingredients listed a moment ago, tend to do. “The scalp is no different than your skin and when it’s not balanced, it will overproduce oils,” Masterson says. That’s why your hair will get dirtier faster when you over-wash it or wash it with the wrong ingredients. “We loaded Cocomino up with proteins, hydrating ingredients, plant oils and butters, for a medium-weight formula that rinses cleanly from hair and skin — a talent it owes in large part to it being silicone free,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, that trait is hard to come by. “Silicones in hair [products] are really tough to avoid, because they’re the industry-wide shortcut to getting smoother, shinier hair,” says Masterson. “Unfortunately, they’re also insoluble in water and have a tendency to build up on the hair and scalp. So finding alternatives that accomplished those benefits wasn’t easy, but we love a challenge and think we’ve cracked the code to haircare formulas that don’t rely on them, but still smooth, boost shine and help strengthen the hair.” The marula butter formula gives you a beautiful shine and softness to your hair (even with curly and frizzy hair types) that will have you reaching for this bottle every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Marula butter, coconut amino-acid blend, mongongo oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-umbra-sheer-physical-daily-defense-face-sunscreen-spf-30></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Daily Defense Face Sunscreen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer&amp;acirc;&amp;cent; Physical Daily Defense Face Sunscreen SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jYJrymcTZ5odI9n2_4g-ByJqbtE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drunk-elephant-umbra-sheer-physical-daily-defense-face-sunscreen-spf-30-16fb736076cc4e2187373d8148a4f8c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It’s a sheer and tinted formula so it doesn’t leave a white cast.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Has nourishing ingredients like raspberry seed oil and vitamin C to prevent free-radical damage.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The formula is water soluble and easily cleans off the skin.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sunscreen is more varied than you might realize. “For me, I didn’t know the difference between chemical and physical sunscreen,” says Masterson. Chemical sunscreen can be inflammatory and absorbs UV rays once they’ve reached your skin. Physical sunscreen sits on top of the surface and blocks the rays from meeting your skin. One challenge of using a physical sunscreen formula — especially one with 20 percent pure zinc oxide — is it’s extremely whitening. “We wanted it to work for all skin tones,” she says, so they developed a sheer and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tinted sunscreen</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula is completely silicone free, and has other nourishing ingredients like raspberry seed oil, vitamin C, and sunflower sprout extract, which all help protect against free-radical damage. The formula is water soluble and can be easily cleaned off the skin. Though Masterson reminds us not to include this product in the smoothie if you use that technique because it can lessen the efficacy of the SPF. Just apply it on top of your other products once they dry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 3 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> 20% pure zinc oxide, sunflower shoot extract, astaxanthin-rich algae extract, raspberry seed oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-b-goldi-bright-drops-with-5-niacinamide></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant B-Goldi Bright Drops</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drunk Elephant B-Goldi Bright Drops" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RMxXrTyoo5WTHK7j0I2WgXp7HbI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drunk-elephant-b-goldi-bright-drops-c4a28de0aca643c1bd94b2d10d0d9803.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Drunk Elephant</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>Packed with niacinamide which boosts skin health through texture, appearance, and hydration.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Increases the suppleness and softness of your complexion.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the newest launches in the Drunk Elephant collection, the B-Goldi Bright Drops work to restore the appearance of one’s skin.

She says sometimes you might be using a product and not see the inflammatory effects until you go to use a stronger ingredient like acid, vitamin C, or retinol and then you think your skin is too sensitive. In many cases, “it’s the surrounding ingredients like drying alcohol, and essential oil, and the fragrance, and dye, etc.” that’s actually irritating your skin, she says.</p><p><br>Dubbed a “Drunk Break”, Drunk Elephant encourages you to solely use its products for 30 days as a reset to your skin. Similar to how you would diagnose a stomach issue by eliminating certain foods, a “drunk break” gives your skin an ingredient elimination diet because these products are made without common irritants. “If skin doesn't have to process these inflammatory ingredients, then [it] can reset […]and do what it knows how to do,” says Masterson. In order to save you some money upfront, there are even kits you can buy with smaller versions of key products so you can try the “break” and if it works for you, then you can invest in larger sizes.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can I mix Drunk Elephant products?</span></p><p>The answer is a resounding heck yes. In fact it’s encouraged to mix these products in what Masterson calls a facial “smoothie.” Since these products are silicone free, they don’t have the larger molecules that sit on the skin and are much more amenable to mixing and absorption. “Really the only thing that we don’t mix with the smoothie is the sunscreen because that goes on top, and does have a larger molecule,” says Masterson.&nbsp;</p><p><br>She says this method also saves a ton of wasted product because when you apply it individually, you end up using two pumps of this, three pumps of that — smoothie-ing only requires one pump of each product. Just mix in your hands and then apply to your face and neck. “And the good news for your skin is [it] doesn’t need that much,” she says. “We make it to where the skin can take and absorb and use what we’re giving it.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Who is Drunk Elephant’s target consumer?</span></p><p>Drunk Elephant puts the control in the hands of the customer. “We don’t want to tell them exactly what to use; we want to say this is our philosophy, stay within it and use what you want,” says Masterson. And as far as who that customer is? “There’s something for everybody. It’s easily digestible [and] not intimidating,” Masterson says. “Products like the marula oil, marula butter, sili lotion, beste cleanser [are] very basic — all of those products are incredible for babies, and for children. Same thing for teenagers, and [then] we start to get into some of the acids, the retinol. Men, women, very mature skin; I have clients up in their 80s, and I’ve got teenage boys who can’t get enough of the hair products and facial products.”</p><p><br>She says she’ll have moms call her and ask what the product was that their kids used at her house because they love it and want their parents to buy it. “It’s men taking it from their wives, and my mother and all of her friends,” says Masterson. “The approach is ‘skin is skin’ and that’s my motto. It all deserves to be treated with respect. It [all] has an acid mantle and we treat it with the same nourishing ingredients.” The only difference for people is they may use more or less of a product (like moisturizer!) than someone else depending on their skin type and specific concerns.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a senior commerce writer for PEOPLE who’s tested hundreds of lifestyle products across all categories.
