He was also stripped of his MBE and OBE.</p><p>Disturbing footage has also&nbsp;<a href=#>resurfaced of him joking with Jimmy Savile about keeping a young girl "safe".</a></p><p><a href=#>Sickening scenes from Savile’s BBC show</a>&nbsp;Jim’ll Fix It also sees Harris snarl: "She is anxious to run away."</p><p>The child abusers appeared on screen together in the 1976 episode alongside a little girl who wanted to paint with Harris.</p><p>There is no suggestion the girl in the clip was abused by either Savile or Harris.</p><p>The programme detailed how Harris’ 60-year career came crashing down when a childhood pal of his only child, Bindi, - known as Victim A - came forward alleging Harris groomed her aged just 13.</p><p>A victim impact statement read out in court in 2014 said: "The attacks that happened have made me feel dirty, grubby and disgusting. The whole sordid saga has traumatised me.</p><p>"I have panic attacks and suffer from anxiety. The effects of the abuse have been with me for many years. I started drinking at the age of 14 to 15 years old.</p><p>"This was to block out the effects of what he was doing to me."</p><p>In 2019, Rolf Harris was seen breaking cover - walking on to the grounds of a primary school in 2019.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He was told to leave by the head teacher of the school in Maidenhead, Berks.&nbsp;<a href=#>But not before he was able to wave at the assembled schoolchildren.</a></p><p>A witness, who took pictures of Harris stalking the grounds, said: “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ391gZFva3JnoqS5p3nHmqmroaNisKLB0p5kqJ5dmbKiwMdmqZ6ulZa5prCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./juan-mata-manchester-united-bill-gates-malala-norwegian-pm-erna-solberg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Juan Mata plays table football with Bill Gates, Malala and Norwegian PM Erna Solberg">&larr;
