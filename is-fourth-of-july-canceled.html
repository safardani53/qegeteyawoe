It's almost as if <a href=#>cancel culture</a> is the only culture this country thrives on.</p><p>Already, we've canceled <a href=#>Dave Chapelle</a>, <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a>, and <a href=#>Louis C.K.</a> — to name a few — for things they did and said. And now, folks on Twitter are trying to cancel a national holiday. In fact, many are claiming that <a href=#>the Fourth of July</a> should get the boot in 2023 due to the current state of the nation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Do you agree? Keep reading to find out why some folks just aren't so crazy about celebrating Independence Day this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TBH, a lot of stuff is going down in America.</h2><p>Welcome to America in 2023. We have never seen the country as divided as it is today. It feels as if the nation is going to tear itself apart like it was 1861. We can't even speak to each other with respect anymore, and honestly, it's really hard to be respectful when people hold such reprehensible views that go against what this country is supposed to stand for.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Alan Arkin</a> died. Have you seen Little Miss Sunshine? You should. And anything else he did. It will help you forget that America is one of the biggest polluters in the world, and our love of big cars is causing the ice caps to melt and is increasing the greenhouse effect. He's also pretty funny in So, I Married an Ax Murderer.</p><p>We've got literal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazis protesting</a> outside of Disney World for being inclusive of the LGBTQIA+ community. Luckily, Indiana Jones is back in the theaters with his new movie <a href=#>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a> as well, so maybe <a href=#>Harrison Ford</a> can go down there and straighten things out, Indy-style.</p><p>Hmm, what else? Gas prices are high AF. It's getting more expensive to be alive. Netflix up and raised its prices on all U.S. plans and made it so you can use your cousin Eddie's password anymore. The other streamers also look like they are struggling. And <a href=#>Dollar Tree</a> is now Dollar and 25 Cents Tree.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We gotta cancel 4th of July this year.

Yeah, well that happened. Oh, and it's OK to discriminate against people if it's 'against your religious beliefs, even if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">you allegedly made up the whole story</a> that got you to a Supreme Court hearing.</p><p>These days, it's pretty easy to own a gun. Seriously, I'm in Texas right now and I could go get a gun and a cheeseburger and be back in less than an hour. Depending on traffic, of course. Perhaps, it's the most American thing of all is that we're still honoring the second amendment, which was written in the 1700s. Personally, I'm a constitutional originalist and I'm going to protect my family and property with a muzzle-loading musket. Take that, Red Coats!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We need to cancel Fourth Of July Holiday this year! Shame on United States Supreme Court for doing this! 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😡</p>— TJ Radway 🎸🌉🇯🇲🇺🇸🎶💙 (@tjradway7) <a href=#>June 30, 2023</a></figure><p>Let's not forget, the Supreme Court <a href=#>overturned Roe v. Wade last year</a>, which means abortion is no longer a constitutional right in the U.S. For many women, this feels like a huge violation of their freedom. So, whip out some sparklers and light one up for America, right? Right?</p><p>Many immigrants who came to this country for a better life, like my family did, are now being denied that right and it is becoming harder in many states to get access to education and a good job. Instead, states like Texas and Florida are making it impossible to live there. Sure, all the crap jobs no one else wants to do like work in Florida's orange groves in 95 degrees won't be filled and the agricultural economy will crash, but whatever. Both Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump, the leading candidates for the Republican nomination have both spoken about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doing away with the 14th amendment</a> to the Constitution which guarantees citizenship to naturally born people. So, do I still qualify as an American? Do you?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>On the 4th of July this year, I won’t be celebrating.

The Left has got some stuff they need to deal with urgently as well. While not as much of an existential threat to life on Earth, they are still pretty obnoxious sometimes. Especially with their use of canceling people and things they deem offensive, as mentioned before. What is offensive? Offensive to whom? While I think that racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc are terrible things and shouldn't be said...aren't we taking some of this canceling stuff too far? It seems like people are getting canceled for relatively minor sins against the PC Gods.</p><p>So, is America's birthday still happening? Yes, there will be a day between July 3rd and 5th that will very much take place. But clearly, not everyone is in a festive mood this year. Perhaps, we can treat it as a fun day off from work? Think: a Summer Tuesday. Anyone?</p><p>Also, let's get rid of Columbus Day already too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuss6uqa2gXaSzbrbUpbBmm5GjsKa4xJ0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kally-wayne.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kally Wayne">&larr;
