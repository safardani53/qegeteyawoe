actress was transformed into a rock ’n’ roll vixen in a plunging leather corset as she cavorted in the back of a classic red Mercedes convertible.</p><img

the band’s image over its amazing six-decade career.</p><p>And as well as picking eye candy, the band seem to have an innate ability to choose the edgiest, coolest women of the moment to become Stones icons, muses — and sometimes lovers.</p><p>Over the years the Stones have managed to persuade some of the world’s most famous women to put on risque outfits and appear in their music videos.</p><p>As well as <a href=#>Sydney</a>, the list includes True Romance star Patricia Arquette and Girl With A Dragon Tattoo beauty Noomi Rapace, who bared her chest in the band’s 2012 video for the track Doom And Gloom.</p><p>Actress <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>, Spanish model Marina Ontanaya, actress couple Marguerite Thiam and Nailia Harzoune, and Mexican actress Elpidia Carrillo have all had starring roles in Rolling Stones projects.</p><p>They join the ranks of some of the hippest musical muses associated with the group.</p><p>Kristen, 33, was flying high after her role as Bella Swan in the Twilight Saga film series when she showed off her sexy side in the Stones’ video Ride ’Em On Down in 2016, performing a gritty dance in an empty fuel station.</p><p>Marguerite and Nailia were filmed having a wild night in Paris for the band’s song Living In The Heart Of Love, which was originally recorded for the 1981 album Tattoo You, and which the rockers dedicated to their late drummer <a href=#>Charlie Watts</a> two years ago.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The two women are seen having a debauched night in the French capital, skipping out on a bar bill and dancing at various clubs before passionately kissing.</p><p>The pair are both well known in France and Marguerite is famous for her role in the French Netflix series The 7 Lives Of Lea.</p><p>The Stones are renowned for promoting beautiful girls throughout their careers and Mexican star Elpidia was yet to find international fame in the Predator sci fi movies when she featured in the band’s 1983 video Undercover Of The Night.</p><p>Patricia Arquette had not long since filmed True Romance with her future husband <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> when she agreed to appear in the video for the Stones’ cover version of Bob Dylan’s Like A Rolling Stone in 1995.</p><p><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> had just filmed Hackers when she played a stripper in the promo for the song Anybody Seen My Baby in 1997 — and Mick Jagger became obsessed, badgering her for a date.</p><p>He is reported to have said: “She scared me a little — I like that.”</p><p>Angelina was married to <a href=#>Jonny Lee Miller</a> at the time — but it didn’t stop Mick from bombarding her with calls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

rocker, described them as “astonishing” and added that the singer was “virtually sobbing”.</p><p>In the end Angelina relented and the pair went on a date, but a book about <a href=#>Mick</a> by author Christopher Anderson claims that he sneaked away for a one-night stand with Farrah Fawcett.</p><p>Probably the first of the stunning women who have always been at the heart of the band’s music was singer Marianne Faithfull, who dated Mick from 1966 to 1970 — coinciding with arguably the Stones most creative period.</p><p>Marianne was an aspiring 17-year-old folk singer when they met at a party and she is believed to be the inspiration behind ‘Wild Horses’.</p><p>She once claimed that the ‘wild horses couldn’t keep me away line’ was the first thing Jagger said to her when she emerged from a drug-induced coma in 1969.</p><p>Despite a rocky four years together Marianne later described Jagger as a “fabulous, intelligent, cultivated, kind man.”</p><p>A year before Faithfull came on the scene, the band met the sexy, risque German-Italian actress Anita Pallenberg.</p><p>Often referred to as the sixth Rolling Stone, she bedded both Brian Jones and <a href=#>Keith Richards</a> and was rumoured to have had an affair with Mick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/marina-ontanaya-appears-criss-cross-843165277.jpg><p>But Anita, who died in 2017, was no groupie.</p><p>She was the driving force behind the band and the hit Gimme Shelter was written by Richards as he became suspicious of an affair between her and Jagger.</p><p>Anita also sang backing vocals for 1968’s Sympathy for the Devil and Mick was said to have remixed tracks on the album Beggars Banquet based on her feedback.</p><p>She went on to have three kids with Richards who later said: “She scared the pants off me.</p><p>“She knew everything and she could say it in five languages.”</p><p>In their heyday the band’s loves were integral to their music.</p><p>The song Respectable, on 1978’s Some Girls album, was said to be about Mick’s ex-wife Bianca who he wed in 1971.</p><p>They split seven years later and Bianca, who was four months pregnant when they married, later said “groupies weren’t an easy thing to get used to.”</p><p>She said: “Mick is in some ways misogynistic because there are too many women available to him.”</p><p>Soul singer Claudia Lennear is credited as the muse for the group’s most controversial song, Brown Sugar, from 1971.</p><p>She was a member of a vocal trio called Ikette when she dated Mick in 1969.</p><p>Despite a furore over its racist lyrics, Claudia has defended the song, calling it “one of the greatest rock songs of all time”.</p><p>But not every woman who has fallen under the Stones’ glare has been happy.</p><p>The cover of their 1978 album Some Girls provoked the ire of Raquel Welch, Farrah Fawcett and the families of Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland, whose images all appeared amid a garishly coloured spoof cosmetics advert.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Unhappy with the unflattering design, they sued the Stones for using their likenesses without permission.</p><p>Hopefully Sydney Sweeney is happier with her Stones starring role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
