Big thanks to all the team at Reebok and specially Authentic brands group for trusting me with this!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on tommy mallet">read more on tommy mallet</h2><p>Fans flocked to the comment section to congratulate <a href=#>Tommy</a>, with one calling the collaboration a "game changer".</p><p>"You deserve this so so much Tommy!" one wrote, while another said: "Big boss moves".</p><p>Tommy and fiancée&nbsp;<a href=#>Georgia&nbsp;Kousoulou</a> bought a holiday home in <a href=#>Majorca </a>last year and they plan on making it their full-time home.</p><p>They've shared <a href=#>snippets of the inside</a>, which features beautiful ceilings with wooden beams and marble floors.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Reality</h2></p><p>The couple have been slowly decorating the pad with minimalistic furniture and touches.</p><p>While Tommy might be living a life of luxury now; treating himself to a <a href=#>customised Ferrari</a> and flying around the world - it wasn't always like that for the dad-of-one.</p><p>He grew up on a council estate in <a href=#>North London</a> and left <a href=#>school </a>with no <a href=#>GCSEs</a>.</p><p>His upbringing is what actually inspired him to create his footwear brand, as he was bullied at school for the clothes he wore.</p><p>The businessman said that he was humiliated when he was just 12 because his family couldn't afford to buy him fashionable trainers.</p><p>He trained as a carpenter after school before joining the cast of Towie - which is where he met his<a href=#> fiancée Georgia</a>.</p><p>Speaking about his childhood, he told <a href=# aria-label="MailOnline (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a>: "I feel like at one point in my life I definitely could have had the potential to go down the wrong path but ultimately, I knew that I wanted to do things the right way and to succeed.</p><p>"So staying on the right track was important to me."</p><p>His shoe brand is favored by the likes of <a href=#>Drake</a>,<a href=#> Olly Murs</a>, <a href=#>Craig David</a>, and <a href=#>Will.i.am.</a></p><p>He launched Mallet in 2015 and by 2020 the business had clocked up 11.8million sales.</p><p>His shoes and apparel is stocked in over 150 stores around the world, and that's only going to increase.</p><p>Tommy, who made the Forbes 30 under 30 list, says he prefers to be known for his work rather than his time on reality tv.</p><p>He told MailOnline that it's an "amazing feeling" to walk around Paris during fashion week and "90 percent" of people know him for his brand - rather his TOWIE background.</p><p>That being said, Tommy is still a familiar face on television.</p><p>He and <a href=#>Georgia</a>, who <a href=#>share Brody</a>, star in their own <a href=#>ITV </a>show <a href=#>Baby Steps</a>.</p><p>They captured the hearts of viewers after they filmed through <a href=#>Georgia's miscarriage</a>.</p><p>Speaking to the camera,&nbsp;<a href=#>Tommy</a>&nbsp;said: "Unfortunately we didn't get the results that we were staying positive for and <a href=#>Georgia's had a miscarriage</a>."</p><p><a href=#>The devastated mum</a> broke down in tears and said: "When someone says that baby's not going to make it, it's like 'what do you mean?', I don't get it."</p><p>Curled up on the sofa wearing a pair of grey leggings and a matching sweatshirt,&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;told Tommy: "I don't think I've ever felt pain like it."</p><p>Fighting back her tears, she added: "It's so hard ain't it," while Tommy was seen looking heartbroken as he dealt with his grief.</p><p>He's also recently launched a new business venture under the name: "Tommy's Journey".</p><p>The account is private and simply has "Wellness. The Next Chapter - Announcement 1/12/23" written in the bio.</p><p>Shortly after his Reebok announcement, he shared a photo of him in a tan trench coat and Mallet trainers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"Thank you so much everyone for the love and positivity!
