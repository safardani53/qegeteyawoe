That I couldn’t be that person that I knew deep down I was.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More in Weddings">Read More in Weddings</h2><p>But when Mel appeared on <a href=#>TLC</a>’s hit series Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire back in 2020, she realised not everyone was a fan of her gown choice – in particular her mother-in-law Denise.</p><p>When the show aired three years ago, Mel – who has a butterfly <a href=#>tattoo</a> to “symbolise her transition” from feeling like a caterpillar to becoming a butterfly – stepped out in the daring dress after trying on slightly more modest ones.</p><p>She then exclaimed: “I love it, I do, I absolutely love it.</p><p>“It’s me. I look in [the mirror] and I feel proud of myself – I feel proud of my body, I feel proud of what I’ve achieved. This is my story dress.”&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>But it was clear from the off that Denise was not impressed with the risque number which featured transparent lace that barely covered her body.</p><p>Denise put her hands to her face as she screamed “oh no!” as her jaw continued to drop.</p><p>And after promising she’d be quite “firm” with her opinion, she said: “I’ve got a lot of respect for you, Mel.</p><p>“And I know you’ve come a long way and I know a little bit about your story… But that is definitely a no.</p><p>“It’s not you, darling. And it’s making me feel quite ill looking at it. I really don’t like it.”</p><p>Denise then took her criticism of the outfit one step further when she said it was “vile.”</p><p>She continued on her rant: “I can’t see the softer Mel in there. You could maybe wear it for bed or something…”</p><p>As Mel suggested she could wear a nice pair of white knickers with diamantes on to upgrade it even further, Denise simply shook her head.</p><p>But it seems Denise wasn’t alone as Mel’s best friend Leanne sided with her and said she liked nothing about the dress.</p><p>She explained: “Babe, it’s your wedding day, and Olly would have a fit.”&nbsp;</p><p>Recalling the moment, Mel said: “Olly’s mum’s face just went bright red – I think she wanted to cry.”</p><p>She later added: “They were all like, ‘no, no, I hate it.’ And I was like, ‘hold on, I really like this – so I’m going to take this where I want to go with it.”</p><p>Mel later settled on a compromise between her and the bridal party, opting for a slightly sheer dress but with the formality of others that left her in tears.</p><p>After Mel described it as “utterly perfect”, it also got the stamp of approval from the others – even mother-in-law Denise.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She concluded: “The smile on her face in that dress, it was lovely.”</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
