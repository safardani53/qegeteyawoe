Soon, he was joined by his three friends, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood, and Ashton Irwin.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In 2014, the four friends established their band, 5SOS. They have released many hits like ‘She Looks So Perfect,’ ‘End Up Here,’ ‘Jet Black Heart,’ and ‘Youngblood.’ <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apart from them being musicians, one thing common between the members is that they have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tattoos</a>. Hood has 17 tattoos, Clifford has six, Irwin has nine, and Hemmings has four tattoos. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here is a breakdown of all <a href=# rel=follow>tattoos</a> Hemmings has.&nbsp;</p><h2>Luke Hemmings's Tattoos&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The singer was the last of the 5SOS to get inked. The exact date of his tattoos is not known, however, fans started noticing them in 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hemmings has all four tattoos on his hands. They are of a bird, years, and tally marks.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer’s most prominent tattoo is a bird inked on his right arm, near the armpits. It looks like a Hummingbird or a Mockingbird with its wings spread wide open.&nbsp;</p><p>The tattoo also slightly resembles the fictional bird from the Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay. However, to date, Hemmings has not revealed the meaning behind the bird.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The singer has tally marks inked on his right wrist. He has not revealed the meaning behind this tattoo as well, but fans have their presumptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Irwin and Hood have similar tattoos on their hands. It was Irwin’s first tattoo, and he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;it represented their band. Therefore, fans presume that Hemmings’s tally marks mean 5SOS.&nbsp;</p><p>The third and fourth tattoos inked on the singer are two years —&nbsp; 1965 on his left wrist and 1966 on his right wrist. These tattoos are very wholesome and mean a lot to Hemmings since it is the birth year of his parents.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He revealed the tattoos to his fans and followers via Instagram stories on October 3, 2019. He penned a heartfelt caption paying an homage to his parents — “Every day I look down and got my parents with me.”</p><p>Hemmings was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dressed</a> as a tattoo-laden Ryan Gosling for Halloween 2020. Many people thought the tattoos inked on the singer were real, however, all of them were fake.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Is Luke Hemmings Dropping a Solo Album?&nbsp;</h2><p>5SOS has been together since its formation. However, they have been on a hiatus since 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Irwin dropped his first solo album in September 2020, and it seems like Hemmings is following his lead.&nbsp;</p><p>2021 is definitely the year for Hemmings. He&nbsp;got engaged to his longtime girlfriend and&nbsp;is also embarking on a solo music journey.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On June 8, 2021, Hemmings took to Instagram to announce that he was engaged to his girlfriend, Sierra Deaton.</p><p>He proposed to her with a pear-shaped ring and revealed that they were engaged earlier this year. However, he did not mention the exact date of engagement.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>On June 28, 2021, he took to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>, Instagram, and the 5SOS&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> to tease his upcoming project. He uploaded a short video of him working in a studio at the end, which said, “When facing the things we turn away from.”</p><p>Via captions, he hinted he would make the announcement tomorrow at 9 PM PT,&nbsp;presumably where he will announce his new project — a solo album.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6HCrLGMoZympZmjtLR505qrraefqHupwMyl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeff-stelling-soccer-saturday-worksop-town.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Soccer Saturday legend Jeff Stellings plea to save Worksop Town from financial ruin the fourth">&larr;
