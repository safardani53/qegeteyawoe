style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377507053.jpg><h2>Who is Barbara Coombes?</h2><p>Barbara Coombes, 63, has been <a href=# rel=noopener>jailed for nine years on July 11 for her father Kenneth's manslaughter in 2006</a>, after cops found his body in the garden of her Stockport home.</p><p>The <a href=#>mum-of-one was charged after a woman allegedly walked into&nbsp;Cheadle Heath Police Station in January 2018</a> and told police that a man had been killed "a number of years ago".</p><p>Officers then began to search the home in Reddish, discovering the remains of Barbara's father, former soldier Kenneth Coombes, in the garden.</p><p>Coombes had been accused of murdering her dad, as well as preventing the lawful and decent burial of a dead body.</p><p>The-63-year-old was also accused of fraud by false representation after allegedly claiming to be a carer of the elderly man for more than 10 years after his death.</p><p>On July 11, she appeared via video link at Manchester Crown Court and pleaded guilty to her dad's manslaughter by diminished responsibility&nbsp;and was jailed for nine years at Manchester Crown Court.</p><p>Sentencing Coombes to nine years, Mr Justice King said she told a "series of elaborate lies to cover your tracks".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Barbara-Coombes.jpg><h2>How did her father die?</h2><p>Barbara Coombes, 63, twice hit Kenneth Coombes, 87, over the head with a shovel before slashing his throat, a court was told.</p><p>She watched him bleed to death and ordered a tonne of soil to bury him the following day, a court heard.</p><p>The court heard how in January 2006, Barbara Coombes had been gardening at her father’s home on Matlock Road in Stockport.</p><p>Coombes then went into the house and saw a box of photographs on the dining table, which she started looking through.</p><p>When she realised these were explicit images of a child, Coombes took the spade she had been using from the garden and confronted her 87-year-old father Kenneth in the lounge.</p><p>Coombes struck him in the back of the head first, then when he turned to face her, she struck him a second time with the spade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Barbara-Coombes-sentencing-3.jpg><p>She then wrapped her father in a rug and dragged his body outside, where she buried him behind a tree.</p><p>The following day Coombes ordered a tonne of soil which was used to bury Kenneth in their back garden.</p><p>To explain her father’s sudden disappearance to the rest of the family, Coombes said Kenneth had died and the hospital had arranged for his cremation.</p><p>After the makeshift burial, Coombes cleared out Kenneth’s belongings from the house.</p><p>His body lay undiscovered for 12 years until she walked into Reddish police station in January this year to admit her crime after council officials asked to see him.</p><p>On the day of his death she felt a "black cloud" over her and hit him twice with a shovel in a "haze of disgust" while gardening.</p><p>In a statement to police Coombes said she had been mentally and physically abused by her dad since she was a child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377507047.jpg><h2>When did her father Kenneth go missing?</h2><p>After the confession, cops were seen and issuing questionnaires to neighbours, asking them if they knew Mr Coombes, particularly focusing on the years 2004 and 2005.</p><p>Kenneth vanished in 2006 and the former soldier's remains were unearthed in Coombes' back garden by police in January.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
