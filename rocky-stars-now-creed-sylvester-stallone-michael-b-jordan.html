RIP."</p><p>As fans and co-stars remember the late actor, we look at what happened to the rest of the cast from the early Rocky movies.</p><h2>Sylvester Stallone - Rocky Balboa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1976-now-sylvester-stallone-788984359.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/d14cd864-d071-4da0-87a5-fe1599100504.jpg><p><a href=#>Stallone</a> wrote and starred in Rocky, which earned £125 million at the box office&nbsp;- a runaway smash hit in 1976.</p><p>It was nominated for 10 Oscars and won three, including Best Picture, but Stallone walked away with just his acting fee after failing to secure the rights.</p><p>It still remains a bone of contention with the actor, who recently blasted filmmaker Irwin Winkler, who has made a fortune from the franchise.</p><p>But the film catapulted Stallone into superstardom and he went on to win iconic roles in Rambo and Demolition Man.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Stallone’s love life has been rocky.&nbsp; His first marriage to photographer Sasha Czack in 1974 ended 11 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He cheated on Sasha with American actress Susan Anton - despite having two children: Seargeoh, 44, who played Balboa’s baby in Rocky II, and Sage, who tragically died of heart disease aged 36 in 2012.</p><p>Seargeoh was diagnosed with autism aged three and Stallone and Czack have both worked with charities supporting children with the condition.</p><p>Ten months after splitting from Sasha he wed statuesque model Brigitte Nielson who reportedly introduced herself to him by sending a saucy pic of herself to his hotel room.</p><p>She starred with him in Rocky IV in 1985 and Creed II in 2018 but their marriage only lasted 19 months.</p><p>Stallone has been wed to model Jennifer Flavin since 1997 but their relationship has been rocky.</p><p>The couple, who met when she was 19 and he was in his early 40s, split for the first time in 1994 before they tied the knot - when he dumped her via a FedEx.</p><p>Jennifer later discovered she had been dumped over Stallone’s affair with supermodel <a href=#>Janice Dickinson</a>. He was widely rumoured to be the father of her baby daughter but when a paternity test revealed he wasn’t, he dropped her.</p><p>Stallone and Jennifer reconciled and had a daughter, Sophia, in 1996, who runs the Favorite Book Club account with 1.5 million followers on Instagram.</p><p>Sistine Rose followed in 1998 and Scarlet in 2002.</p><p>Flavin, 55, filed for divorce from Stallone, 77, in August last year but the couple were back together by Christmas.</p><h2>Brigitte Nielsen - Ludmilla Drago</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1976-now-brigitte-nielsen-788984362.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3fe4ae5f-c25d-4209-bf23-af079543b18e-1.jpg><p>Brigitte was married to Stallone when she starred in Rocky IV as the cold-hearted Soviet wife of Ivan Drago.</p><p>She later described it as a “horrible marriage” and said it harmed her career.</p><p>Brigitte, 60, said: “After I left Sylvester I kind of felt like I was blacklisted for a long time. I am almost positive that had I not been in the public eye with this famous man, that would never have happened. But they always thought: after Stallone, who is going to be next?”</p><p>Brigitte, who also starred in Beverly Hills Cop II, has been married five times and has four sons and a daughter.</p><p>She once described how she slapped <a href=#>Madonna</a> in a club after she was “rude” and “kept stepping on my feet” - then had revenge sex with the singer’s ex Sean Penn a few months later in France.</p><p>Brigitte has twice been in rehab for alcoholism and appeared drunk on reality show The Surreal Life in 2005.</p><h2>Talia Shire - Adrian Balboa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1976-now-talia-shire-788984364.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5b076053-2109-4fc5-94c2-a9e8ff5cc97f.jpg><p>One of Rocky’s most iconic moments comes when he yells “Yo Adrian, I did it’” after beating Apollo Creed in Rocky II.</p><p>Adrian was played by Talia Shire, who is the sister of producer Francis Ford Coppola and the aunt of actor Nicolas Cage and director Sophia Coppola.</p><p>Talia, now 77, also portrayed Don’s daughter Connie Corleone in <a href=#>The Godfather</a> movies but one scene in the legendary movies led to a defamation lawsuit in America.</p><p>Paramount+ recently told the story of how the Godfather was made in a scripted series called ‘The Offer’, told from the perspective of producer Al Ruddy.</p><p>Al is being sued by actor Gianna Russo because his character in The Offer is shown going ‘off-script’ and actually hitting Talia for a domestic violence scene.</p><p>Gianna is suing Ruddy saying: “I never touched Talia with my hand.</p><p>“Talia’s parents were on the set. My own mother had been beaten and was institutionalised. And my grandchildren who heard this got upset.”</p><h2>Carl Weathers - Apollo Creed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1976-now-carl-weathers-788984363.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/0ea6e893-60ea-4ecf-9f4a-9f20729725c3.jpg><p>Carl played Rocky’s rival and later his friend in the first four Rocky films.</p><p>But acting was not his first love.&nbsp;</p><p>Carl, 75, played professional football for the Oakland Raiders in California and started working as a film extra. He got a role in Starsky & Hutch and quit football to pursue Hollywood in 1975.</p><p>He landed the role of Apollo after criticising Stallone’s acting.</p><p>Weathers read through his lines with Stallone then, unaware he was dealing with the main star, told him: "It would be better if you got me a real actor to work with."</p><p>Stallone felt the jab was something like the character Apollo would say - and Weathers landed the gig.</p><p>He also starred in <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>’s Liberian Girl music video which attracted a plethora of celebrities including Richard Dreyfuss, John Travolta, Whoopi Goldberg and Jacko’s pet monkey, Bubbles.</p><p>Carl’s career has gone from strength to strength, appearing in CBS show Tour of Duty, Street Justice and, more recently, Disney’s hugely successful The Mandalorian.</p><h2>Burgess Meredith - Mickey Goldmill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sylvester-stallone-rocky-play-170821.jpg><p>Burgess was an established actor when he played Rocky’s trainer in the first three movies.</p><p>With roles in John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men in 1939 and The Day of the Locust in 1975, Meredith already had Bafta and Golden Globe nominations and was a well-known face for playing the Penguin in the 1960s Batman TV series.</p><p>In the 1950s he had been blacklisted as a ‘communist’ at the height of McCarthyism when <a href=#>America </a>was in the grip of anti-radical hysteria and feared a Bolshevik revolution.</p><p>He later told how he lost friends and jobs as a result.</p><p>Meredith, who suffered from a form of bipolar, was married four times. His first wife Helen Derby Merrien Burgess, the daughter of an American chemical boss, killed herself aged 33, five years after their divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>The dad-of-two, who has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, died in 1997, aged 89. Friend Adam West, who played Batman, spoke at his memorial service.</p><h2>Dolph Lundgren - Ivan Drago</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1976-now-dolph-lundgren-rocky-788984431.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/0e79931d-2f0f-4f12-ba78-b565c3f4318a.jpg><p>Action movie man Dolph is Rocky IV’s central Soviet-born baddie.</p><p>He kills Apollo Creed in a fight early in Rocky IV and later appears in Creed II, training his boxer son Vikto.</p><p>Dolph has starred in more than 80 action movies including The Expendables, Red Scorpion, Aquaman and the titular role in He-Man, Masters of the Universe.&nbsp;</p><p>A karate champion in real-life, he dated singer Grace Jones after becoming her lover in 1981.</p><p>He famously told how the pair engaged in sex orgies as they partied at the famous New York Club Studio 54.</p><p>He later said the orgies involved “at the most, four or five girls",&nbsp;adding: “It’s great in theory but when you have to get up and fight Sylvester Stallone in the morning it’s not such a good thing.”</p><p>Most of his movies went straight to video post Rocky and his marriage to Swedish jewellery designer Anette Qviberg, in 1994, collapsed in 2011.</p><p>He started drinking heavily and says he drifted apart from his two daughters Ida and Greta but they have since reconciled.</p><p>His film fortunes changed again when he and Stallone joined forces for The Expendables in 2010 which was a resounding hit and in June 2020 he got engaged to Norwegian personal trainer Emma Krodal.&nbsp; He is 65 while she is 27.</p><p>While married to Anette, masked raiders broke into the star’s home in Marbella, Spain, and tied up his wife.&nbsp; They threatened her with knives before spotting Lundgren in pictures and fleeing.</p><h2>Joe Spinell - Tony Gazzo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joe-spinell-rocky-788952396.jpg><p>Rocky was employed as muscle by loan shark Tony Gazzo, depicted by Stallone’s close pal Joe Spinell.</p><p>Character actor Joe also played tough guys in The Godfather and Taxi Driver after securing his first role as Mafiosa member Willi Cicci.</p><p>But his life took a downward spiral when he developed a drink and then drug problem.</p><p>He was godfather to Stallone’s son Sage but they had a falling out in 1981 which ‘Sly’ blamed on Joe’s addictions.</p><p>Joe, who wrote the 1980 slasher film Maniac, was married to adult film star Jean Jennings for two years from 1977.
