I think once we had our second one, we totally got it and understood how to manage.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler and Pobre first found out they were pregnant with their third baby during the last week of August. “We did it together,” Keibler says. “We took a pregnancy test and literally revealed it to ourselves at the same time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE’s free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ben Trivett</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ben Trivett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>RELATED GALLERY: </strong>Who’s Due Next? Alejandra, Laura, Cam and 61 More Celebs Who Are Expecting</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But they waited to tell the rest of their family — in particular, Ava. “We wanted to wait until we were going to tell our parents,” Pobre says. “So we told her basically the day before.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Yeah, because she would tell everybody,” Keibler adds. “Which is exactly what she did.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler and Pobre broke the news to the kids that they’d be getting a little brother or sister by showing them <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a picture of the sonogram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We had a picture of the first sonogram and we brought my daughter in,” Keibler says. “My son — he’s too little. He was there with us when we told Ava, but she’s 5. So we expected her to be excited and we showed her a picture of the sonogram and we just said, ‘We have some really exciting news.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She was so excited,” the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>third-time mom-to-be</a> continues. “She was jumping up and down and she was just full of joy, which is heartwarming.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the couple are keeping the baby’s sex under wraps for now, they say Ava is hoping for a little sister.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Since she has a little brother, she’s like, ‘I really hope that I have a little sister,’ ” Keibler says. “And I’m like, ‘Well, you have to be happy for whatever God blesses us with.’ So, because she already has one, I think she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>really wants to have a little sister</a> this time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of the outcome, they say Ava has been the best big sibling to Bodhi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They walk around the house holding hands and Bodhi loves his sister so much,” Keibler says. “He cries when she leaves for school, and then when she comes home from school, he screams. He hears her at the door and just screams. … Seeing that every day is why we want to have more.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Keibler and Pobre told their parents <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>about the pregnancy</a>, Pobre says they were “super excited and shocked.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think my parents were pretty shocked,” Keibler says. “I’m an only child. When I was younger, I always wanted brothers and sisters, and I was always a babysitter and had cousins and loved taking care of little kids. We hadn’t really told them that we were going to try for a third. So it was new news. They were very happy and surprised.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler and Pobre were first introduced by a mutual friend 10 years ago, and always kept in touch. Then, serendipitously, they were seated next to each other on a flight and reconnected. As soon as they got married in 2014, Pobre says he knew he had the desire for a big family with Keibler.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s what we wanted,” he says. “We had one and were like, ‘Let’s keep on going.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler and Pobre split their time now between their homes in Los Angeles and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jackson Hole, where they decided to move</a> after having kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I really wanted to take a break from the spotlight for a little while and focus on family,” Keibler says of the move. “Jared and I both took a few years away from our careers and even took a four-year digital detox. I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was off all social media for</a> four years and it was great. Jackson Hole is a complete opposite lifestyle of Los Angeles. So we were able to really focus on all the things that are really important to us.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ben Trivett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: It’s a Boy! Stacy Keibler Announces the Birth of Her Second Child, Son Bodhi Brooks</strong><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pobre says that he and Keibler visited Jackson Hole for the first time when Keibler was pregnant with Ava in 2014 .</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We went there during the summertime, and we had friends recommend it because I grew up in the [San Francisco] Bay Area,” he says. “I used to go to Tahoe, the Sierras, and love skiing, camping. Those are my fondest memories growing up. … [It] was one of my goals, or passions, to do that with my own children.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That’s when we went there for vacation and we fell in love with the community, and we <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ended up buying and building a house</a> as a vacation home,” he tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler says, “Every time we were there, we didn’t want to leave. We wanted to extend our trip every single time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Then after going back and forth, and when Ava got to a certain point at 3 years old, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>and we’re looking at preschools here in L.A.</a> and then were like, ‘Maybe we should just give it a shot with putting Ava in a preschool [in Jackson Hole],’ ” Pobre says. “They have incredible schools there.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that Ava is old enough, Pobre says she’s enjoying all the things about Jackson Hole that he hoped she would. “Ava’s an amazing skier,” the proud dad praises. “We go hiking. We ride bikes. We go fishing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January, Keibler and Pobre started their non-toxic luxury skincare line for men, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Caldera + Lab</a>, after noticing the toll travel between L.A. and Jackson Hole was taking on their skin. They also noticed the lack of skincare products out there tailored for men.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I joke that it was June when I had Bodhi, and in January we had Caldera + Lab, which was our third child,” Keibler says. “Yeah, we’re having a fourth child.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler explains that she went on a “health journey” about 15 years ago and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>“became super conscious of every ingredient</a>, whether it was on packages of food I was eating or in my beauty products or anything.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When we were pregnant with Ava, we had someone come to the house and do a deep dive into teaching us about toxic products in our house, with our cleaners and household products,” she says. “At first I was trying to get Jared to be like me and I was getting him to be more conscious about his skin care and things. And he was like, ‘You know, thank you, but don’t try to change everything about me.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Then when we had this woman come over and we were pregnant, Jared really started opening his eyes to educating himself about toxic chemicals,” Keibler says. “When we moved to Jackson [Hole] and had this experience with our skin where we really <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>saw that the harsh climate was affecting it</a>, he was more conscious about products. He was using my products and he was using my serums, because that was the only thing that was really helping.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pobre says they then asked, “How come there aren’t any men’s brands doing the same great work in the clean-beauty movement that was happening for women?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That’s when we just got inspired to research it and decided that, ‘Hey, there’s an opportunity <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to do something great for men</a>,’ ” he says. “Dads like me, brothers, etc. … and the idea was born.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Currently, Caldera + Lab has a facial-treatment serum that was specifically designed for men as a simple one-step regime, called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Good</a>. Most of the ingredients used in the serum are wild-harvested in Jackson Hole.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They’re wild-harvested, so that’s one thing that makes our serum super unique,” Keibler says. “We’re the only men’s brand that is made safe and Cosmo certified, which is on the same standards as European levels. That’s really important to us, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>especially for women that are conscious</a> [about buying] products for their men, especially for the holidays.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether they’re dealing with something in business or parenting, Keibler says she and Pobre make a “great team.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Jared and I are really lucky,” she says. “That’s why it was all so easy for us. We’re a great team at home and a great team at work. We co-parent really well together, which makes life very easy for us.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Stacy Keibler.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ben Trivett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Keibler, everything about this current pregnancy has been smooth sailing so far. “I’m super lucky I have really nice pregnancies, and so far, so good,” she says. “I’ve been really healthy and it has been pretty easy so far.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And like with her last two pregnancies, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she plans to have a home birth</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve had two successful home births, so we’ll hopefully do it again,” Keibler says. “[It’s like] going back to that cave-woman mentality. I live a very healthy lifestyle. I feel very comfortable with it and it’s not for everyone and I don’t even recommend it for all, for even some of my own friends. I think it’s something that’s very personal, but I feel very comfortable for myself doing it and have a very supportive family that supports me in it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keibler couldn’t be more excited that her best friend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Dewan</a> — who is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>expecting a baby</a> with boyfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Steve Kazee</a> (she also shares daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Everly</a>, 6½, with ex <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Channing Tatum</a>) — is due around the same time as her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We talk every day and we’re super excited that we’re on this journey together,” she tells PEOPLE. “Everly and Ava are friends, but they’re a year apart. These babies will be the same. They’re only going to be a couple of weeks apart. So we’re super excited.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for whether she and Pobre will <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>have more children in the future</a>, Keibler says it’s up in the air. “Let’s see how it feels to be outnumbered!” the star says with a laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmrKyRmMZut8SimaWdomK9s7HGp5inrF2axbGxwq2gp59dqbWqvsNmmqGhnJl6q63RnptmqJ%2BXv6Z5xLGapa2jnsOmew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tara-reid-talks-surprise-romance-with-tom-brady-in-new-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tara Reid Talks Surprise Romance With Tom Brady in New Interview  Hollywood Life">&larr;
