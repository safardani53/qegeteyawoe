Like, you have to learn, you know what I’m saying?”</p><p>Despite sharing many <a href=#>physical similarities</a> with the musician — including their trademark reddish-brown buzzcuts, beards and blue eyes — Cloud told the outlet he wasn’t sure he could “be prepared to take on someone’s life and legacy and try to replay that.” He continued: “That man is a legend and he’s going to remain one. May he rest in peace, you feel me?”</p><p>Many fans were reminded of the pair’s uncanny resemblance following <a href=#>Cloud’s unexpected death</a> on Monday, July 31. He was 25 years old.</p><p>“Why does this feel like Mac Miller part 2??? I AM NOT OKAY. RIP Angus Cloud,” wrote one social media user on <a href=#>X</a> (<a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>). Another <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “I wanted so badly to see Angus Cloud play as Mac Miller in a Biopic. Damn. RIP to them both. Both died TOO young.”</p><p>Cloud’s family <a href=#>confirmed his passing</a> in a statement on Monday. “It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today. As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways,” they wrote. “Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend.”</p><p>The family went on to state that they hope Cloud’s death will help others battling mental health struggles to know “they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence.” The statement concluded: “We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone. We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss.”</p><p>A cause of death has not yet been revealed. Cloud’s mother, however, called called 911 on Monday to report a “possible overdose” after discovering he had no pulse, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> confirmed. Cloud was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Cloud’s passing comes nearly five years after Miller <a href=#>died at the age of 26</a> in September 2018. Miller’s <a href=#>cause of death</a> was later revealed to be from mixed drug toxicity. An autopsy revealed he had fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol in his system at the time of his accidental death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One year later, <strong>Cameron James Pettit</strong> <a href=#>was charged</a> for allegedly selling Miller fentanyl-laced pills days before his death. <strong>Stephen Walter</strong> and <strong>Ryan Michael Reavis</strong> were <a href=#>also charged in connection to Miller’s death</a> and were sentenced to 17.5 years and over 10 years in prison, respectively. Pettit’s case is still pending as of April 2022.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with their mental health, contact the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeqwG6vy6isnWWjlraleceem2amlauys3nPpZiyZZyatKa6w2akmptdoratuMSrZKKmXZZ6o7XOqaCcZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-spanish-princess-anne-boleyn-season-2-king-henry-catherine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anne Boleyn Will Be In Season 2, EP Confirms  Hollywood Life">&larr;
