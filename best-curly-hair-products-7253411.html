A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>strong detangler</a> is key to easing the process and reducing any pressure on your scalp, which in turn minimizes breakage and split ends. Aunt Jackie’s Knot on My Watch Detangler is excellent quality at a super affordable price point, designed to infuse and trap moisture into your hair with shea butter and olive oil. The “silky slip” technology makes it a breeze to brush through tangles after applying a generous amount of product to particularly knotty areas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The creamy formula is ideal for thick or coarse hair that can stand up to a lot of product; on thin hair, this can build up fairly quickly and should be used sparingly. Those with thicker curls may want to layer this product with leave-in conditioner to maximize smoothness and avoid excess frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 12 oz. | <strong>Best for:</strong> Detangling, avoiding breakage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-styling-gel-briogeo-curl-charisma-frizz-control-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Styling Gel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Curl Charisma Frizz Control Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Briogeo Curl Charisma Frizz Control Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/f0y3nBJc57iVRQUfaaRuhoazEGQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/briogeo-curl-charisma-rice-amino---quinoa-frizz-control-gel-81d631ad79a04973997b82b20fec7576.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Those with wavy, curly, or coily hair who are looking for a flexible hold that doesn’t weigh down their locks.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Styling gel is a non-negotiable in most curly hair routines, and a light-to-medium hold is typically the platonic ideal of what you should look for: It offers gentle definition without weighing down your curls, and will never leave them feeling hairspray-rigid. Briogeo Frizz Control Gel gets a gold star for its powerful and vegan-friendly ingredients, including rice amino acids and quinoa extract. Together, these superstars help seal your hair’s cuticles, which reduces frizz and enhances curl definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we love the balanced texture this gel provides — it’s flexible, so curls are still swingy but but slightly more tame —&nbsp;some hair types might require a stronger hold to achieve the level of definition you want. Plus, if you’re looking to fully lock out frizz, you may want to go with something a bit heavier as well, but know that in return you might end up with a slightly tacky residue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.5 oz. | <strong>Best for:</strong> Gently defining curls, reducing frizz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-relaxing-balm-phyto-phytodfrisant-botanical-hair-relaxing-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Relaxing Balm</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Phyto Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PHYTO Phytod&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;frisant Botanical Smoothing Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FPRGFpjZeQYhb_PSTApD5cGgGWc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PHYTO-Phytodefrisant-Botanical-Smoothing-Balm-b1a7b8a3859e416da90fb1b6542697cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Loaded with plant extracts (think calming chamomile and regenerative sage), this relaxing balm is designed to trap flyaways and gently smooth your curls. Guar gum works to protect the hair follicle from heat and humidity by wrapping it in a soft film-forming gum. While some balms approach pomade territory with their thickness and greasiness, this one feels lightweight yet still effective. It’s designed to protect hair from heat-styling damage, so it’s a must for anyone looking to achieve a silky, frizz-free blowout.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The chemical-free formula smooths out wavy and curly hair thanks to mallow extraction, which locks out water while moisturizing your strands.

While it could just be Ceremonia’s delightful signature scent alone, there’s a bevy of benefits to this revitalizing spray. Ultra lightweight and less gritty than other sprays, this is ideal for a gentle refresh in between wash days, or as a way to add some extra oomph before heat styling. When testing this product, we found that the spray is more of a gentle mist than a gritty powder, offering a healthy dose of moisture without feeling heavy. It also helped our tester achieve more bounce in her kinky, coily hair. When it comes to heat styling, this also offers great hold and added volume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 6.7 oz. | <strong>Best for:</strong> Wavy, curly and coily hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-style-milk-sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-curl--style-milk></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Style Milk</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheaMoisture Curl & Style Milk</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SheaMoisture Coconut &amp;amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp;amp; Style Milk" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iYCUDNfgdmzwFazrieBi-2nkkEY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SheaMoisture-Coconut--Hibiscus-Curl--Style-Milk-dd4861e8f51b488b90fa4f03e31aa53c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This style milk is incredibly high quality for its affordable price point, loading hair up with softening and hydrating coconut oil to maximize softness and movement. Crafted from ethically-traded, sustainable ingredients, the formula is also clean and paraben free. We love that it’s from a Black-owned business that supports communities of women in Africa who handcraft the Raw Shea Butter used in the formula, as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the scent may be too fruity and coconut-forward for some, those who enjoy a summery scent will be glad to have this product in their arsenal.

The wide base also provides serious va-va-voom volume, which is usually what I’m looking for when diffusing. While it can detach occasionally, it’s generally very reliable and is compatible with most standard blow dryers — plus, it’s ultra lightweight, which makes it a cinch to maneuver.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.5 x 6 inches | <strong>Best for:</strong> All hair types, evening out curl pattern</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shampoo-ouidad-advanced-climate-control-defrizzing-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Shampoo</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ouidad Climate Control Defrizzing Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Defrizzing Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zg9ZbQHr4xj5lEKjad8qNL9QLZU=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ouidad-Advanced-Climate-Control-Defrizzing-Shampoo-225d7d0a9ffe4dd8b3eaf14e58623191.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Curly girls know the struggle with shampoo: All too often it feels like it strips your strands of all their moisture, leaving them dry and stringy when you’re just looking for that squeaky-clean feeling. Whatever your curl type, it’s generally a good idea to wait a few days in between washes, as curly hair generally runs dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A super hydrating, gentle and sulfate-free shampoo is key to protecting the healthy natural oils in your hair, and cult curl-brand Ouidad’s Advanced Climate Control Defrizzing Shampoo does exactly what its name says it will — fights against humidity and dryness while getting rid of frizz. It’s also mega hydrating thanks to softening agents like shea butter and ceramides (the naturally occurring protective sheath that keeps the hair cuticle closed). We love the crisp floral scent too, which is feminine without feeling overpowering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8.5 oz. | <strong>Best for:</strong> Combating humidity, smoothing frizz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-conditioner-pantene-pro-v-curl-perfection-conditioner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Conditioner</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pantene Curl Perfection Conditioner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pantene Pro-V Curl Perfection Conditioner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/x2tBvyIGRnQ2Csvc06QNUBYmY0M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PantenePro-VCurlPerfectionConditioner-177e5546f6a044f7a19db7bb56db3367.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you opt for drugstore or designer formula, your conditioner will make or break your curls. Having tried my fair share of conditioners on either end of the spectrum, I’ve fallen firmly in the camp of preferring drug store brands for their affordability and efficacy. While there are a small handful of more expensive conditioners that have felt worth the price tag — like celeb-loved <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Olaplex’s No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner</a> — those are ones that I treat more like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair masks</a>, given their small size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For daily conditioning, I don’t want to feel overly precious about my product, so I turn to Pantene Pro-V Curl Perfection Conditioner. The family size bottle lasts weeks and the formula is so nourishing that it eliminates the need for detangler. The best part is the frizz calming complex, which seals the cuticle and ensures lasting hydration to maintain your moisture balance.

Powder or aerosol based, they help to soak up the natural oils on your scalp — which can sometimes be problematic when they overly dry out curls. Thanks to the nourishing ingredients in this OGX dry shampoo, there’s no need to worry about that: The spray absorbs the resting oil on your scalp and replaces it with frizz-fighting coconut oil. Our testers reported that while hair didn’t feel completely oil-free afterwards, it looked freshly washed and didn’t feel unpleasantly dried out. This was a win for thinner and finer hair too, as our testers found that it adds a nice volume boost. For those with sensitive noses, take note that the vanilla scent might not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5 oz. | <strong>Best for:</strong> Color-treated hair, dry hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curl-cream-bumble--bumble-curl-defining-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Curl Cream</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bumble & Bumble Curl Defining Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bumble &amp;amp; Bumble Curl Defining Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wN960ZYmASEYsuE4KP1wVHeRsJk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bumble--Bumble-Curl-Defining-Cream-cada22b629924b70a9a812da7262ace6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever seen someone with swishy, salon-perfect curls, they’re probably using Bumble & Bumble’s Curl Defining Cream. “To be completely honest, as a hair stylist I do tend to stray and I like to try and switch up products, but [this is the] one product that I keep going back to,” says Toronto-based hair stylist Melissa Tran, who swears by this rich curl cream for all curl patterns.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Packed with healthy oils like avocado, coconut and jojoba, as well as softening shea and cocoa butter, this curl cream adds immediate bounce and softness to hair while helping to gently define the curl.

Made to protect your strands from UV rays, stripping shampoos and other damaging chemicals, pre-wash is your secret weapon when it comes to hydration and improving hair strength. It’s best applied to damp hair, which helps lock in moisture and can reduce build up of oils and products, allowing your conditioner to better penetrate the strands. We love this creamy ginger-based formula as it’s made with castor oil, which is particularly great for hair growth. It’s also super affordable, which you’ll be grateful for once you realize how quickly it helps your curls thrive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overusing a pre-wash can ultimately have the opposite of a desired effect, leaving hair greasy.

The 1.25-inch barrel allows you to play around with the desired size of your curls, opting for beachy waves, tight spirals or luscious locks. The ceramic barrel also minimizes frizz and uses a unique microchip technology to smooth through hair in just one pass, creating polished curls with minimal heat damage (still, always remember to spritz on a protective heat spray before styling!). Perhaps the best part is the long-lasting 24-hour hold, meaning that your curls will stay up longer than you do. Note that the lower temperature settings go down to 260 degrees, so this is perfect for fine hair as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 13.25 x 1.5&nbsp; x 2.5 inches | <strong>Barrel:</strong> 1.25 inches | <strong>Weight</strong>: 1.5 lbs. | <strong>Best for:</strong> All curl types, natural hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-curly-hair-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Curly Hair Products</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Determine Your Curl Pattern</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Curly hair is different from other routines because each curl pattern is unique.

Rosko adds silicone to the list, noting that it “inhibits absorption of moisture that is crucial for healthy curls [and] it can cause buildup that can be harsh and hard to remove.”</p><p>Be wary of styling products that offer more than medium hold as well, says Tran. “Curly hair likes to move and takes shape on its own — you don’t want anything too stiff looking.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.9696261682243><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you still use curly hair products if you have thin curly hair?</span></p><p>Many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair products</a> are especially formulated for different types of hair, including thin or fine curls, so keep an eye out on labels to find a product that’s targeted just for you.
