Watt</strong> embodies the ideal gentleman. Since his first draft, the top NFL player of 2015 has played for the Houston Texans. Here’s everything you need to know about him>></a></p><h2>Will Hernandez | Early Life</h2><p>Hernandez (fully named William “Will” Hernandez) was born on September 2, 1995, under the star sign Virgo. He is one of the two children of Angelica Lemus and Robert Hernandez, held in Las Vegas, Nevada.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the sources, he grew up in a struggling household, and his parents worked hard to make ends meet. His family moved from Mexico to Las Vegas before Will was born.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about his father, Robert Hernandez used to be professional soccer in Mexico, and hence, it did influence his life. Due to this, Will also commenced playing soccer until 8th grade, when he found the game of football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Will-with-his-family.png><p>However, not much is known about what his mother and sister do. Well, his sister’s name is Kathy Hernandez. In the day, Will’s family was initially hit with a financial crisis that forced them to move out of their home and into a tiny storage unit.&nbsp;</p><p>When they moved to the unit, it consisted of one bedroom with two beds, one living room, and a kitchen for four people. The family stayed on the team for two years before finally moving back to their old house.&nbsp;</p><h3>Education</h3><p>For his early education, Will Hernandez attended Chaparral High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. During his high school days, he discovered his dream of the NFL.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also when Will’s family had to move out of their home to live in a shed they bought from Home Depot. However, the tragedy does not stop here, as right then, Will also had a drop in his grades.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, he started to drop out of high school and then dedicated himself to helping his Dad with the construction company. During his tenure, he took several job responsibilities that included shoveling cement and hauling concrete blocks.</p><p>However, after seeing his condition, Will’s coaches from high school convinced him to get back to school. After the coaches had seen his potential, Will returned to the field and started dedicating his time to upgrading his grade.&nbsp;</p><p>Following his high school graduation, Will enrolled at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).&nbsp;</p><h2>Will Hernandez | Career</h2><p>During his collegiate years, Will Hernandez played for the UTEP team, where he first stood as the redshirt player in the first season.

Right after, he signed a four-year deal with the team and was named the Giants starting left guard.&nbsp;</p><p>During his tenure with the Giants, Will fell into the reserve list due to COVID-19; hence, when he came after his tenure, he stood as a backup for the remainder of the season. Later, in March 2022, Will came to sign a year contract with the Arizona Cardinals.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you look at my life back then and where I am now, it’s completely night and day. I did go through a lot. A lot of it, I can’t complain too much about it because it made me the person I am and shaped me into the player I am. And honestly, I think if I wouldn’t go through all that, I don’t know if I’d be here.”<br>– Will Hernandez</p><h3>Injury</h3><p>Fortunately, Will Hernandez does not have many injuries during his professional tenure. However, in October 2020, Will struggled with novel coronavirus when he tested positive for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, he returned from the reserved list in November of the same year.
