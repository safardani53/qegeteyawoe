"But my mom was always like, 'Girl, no, just wait until you have your first child because you don't know how everything's going to be.' I'm 21 now, so she was like, 'I can't tell you what to do. You look perfect the way you are, but it's whatever you want to do.' So I finally got to do it, and I'm so excited about it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the weeks since the procedure, Carter says the healing process hasn't been "that bad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just had to sit inside for like a good two, three weeks and let everything heal and drop," she says. "I feel like they're still in the process of dropping, but I still love them right now. At first it felt like my chest was a little heavy, but after a while it was cool."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite previously stating on Instagram in 2018 that she was "good" without implants, Carter says her outlook changed as she got older.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I also said I'd never get a wig before, and here I am," she says with a laugh. "It's like, I'm young. I'm growing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carter makes clear, though, that her decision to undergo breast enhancement surgery was not born from insecurity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Reginae always had confidence," she says. "I feel like it makes my little shirts cuter and my outfits come together more, but I have always been comfortable in my own skin. Any enhancement that I wanted to make was my decision. Nobody pressured me. Nobody told me to do this. I feel like I didn't have society telling me this. I feel like it's self-love. I love myself. I loved myself before the boobs, and I love myself after. I don't care what people have to say."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Reginae Carter Talks About Her Tik Tok Videos and Dishes on Her Next 'Slay-cation'</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even before the implants, Carter put that sense of body confidence on display while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>modeling in a campaign</a> for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rihanna's</a> Savage x Fenty lingerie line earlier this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When they first hit me up, I was like, 'Me?!'" she says. "First of all, I love Rihanna. That's the first person that I've ever fan-girled over and cried over. I just love her. She's my favorite artist — besides my daddy. For her team to reach out to me, it was just like, 'Wow.' It was a great experience."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Reginae Carter.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carter credits her father for instilling confidence in her from a young age.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My father always made sure that I was told that I was beautiful," she says. "So growing up, I always had that mentality: I'm pretty, I'm beautiful. Growing up, couldn't nobody tell me I wasn't the s---, okay?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She does admit, though, that it "does hurt sometimes" when people make unsolicited comments about her life and decisions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That gets irritating because it's like, dang, let me live my life," she says. "I'm young. I'm still learning. I want to jump in that water and see how deep it is sometimes. It's so hard because everybody's watched me grow. So they'll be like, 'Oh, girl, you're still a baby.' But it's like, 'No, I own my own home. I pay my own bills. I'm grown. I am about to be 22!'"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lil Wayne and Reginae Carter.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As her 22nd birthday nears on Nov. 29, Carter says she's hoping for a new year full of two things: health and hustle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My goals are to remain healthy and boss up with more work," she says. "I want to act so I've been doing auditions here and there. Acting is my dream."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to acting, Carter has been busy filming her return to VH1's T.I. & Tiny: Friends and Family Hustle and working on her clothing line, Tom Girl, which she created with her aunt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Me and my auntie are like two totally different people," she says. "She has this tomboy type of style, and I'm girly. So we wanted to incorporate both styles where you can either throw on a heel or a shoe with it, so it's like the best of both worlds all in one line. I want to put everything into this clothing line in 2021."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqWgpWWnlsavsdJmm5qtl53Bpr6Mq5ygoZ6Wsm6vwKurnqpdqLxusdecoK2dlGKuo7vUrWSnnadir7OxwKyrZqGdpbmiutOsZKJlnKTDpnnMsqqepJZk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sterling-knights-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sterling Knight Dating  Sterling Knight's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
