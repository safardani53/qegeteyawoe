And if he ever went public with his relationship, it would only be after his partner agreed to the decision.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As for what kind of partner he would be in a relationship, Hoon <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoke</a> with Pinkvilla about it, saying he wanted to be a comfortable person for everyone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Sung Hoon Rumored To Be Dating Girlfriend&nbsp;Park Na Rae</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Back in December 2019, Hoon was rumored to be dating South Korean comedian Park Na Rae. The rumor came about after he helped her hold her dress’s train at the 2019 MBC Entertainment Awards.</p><p>Hoon later <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> in an interview that&nbsp;Na Rae was&nbsp;not his girlfriend, and he was just helping her as her staff could not go in front of the camera.</p><p>His management agency also shared with OSEN that he was not in a relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Sung Hoon Has A Furkid</h2><p>While Hoon has clarified that he doesn't&nbsp;want to get married or have a kid, he is a parent to a dog named Yanghee.</p><p>He initially met Yanghee when&nbsp;working on MBC’s I Live Alone, a reality series that shows the daily life of its cast members.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The actor came across Yanghee at an abandoned dog shelter where she was awaiting euthanasia. She was suffering from measles, skin disease, and pneumonia at the time. He took her in for a 1-month temporary protection period and fostered her during the time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At the end of his fostering period, a family expressed their interest in adapting Yanghee but decided against it after Hoon told them about the health problems. Hoon adopted Yanghee for himself and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">asked</a> people not to abandon their pets. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Rather than saying that people should adopt pets, if they make it so that there are fewer abandoned animals, there would be no need for euthanasia. I’d like it if people wouldn’t abandon [pets].</p><p>Yanghee is much healthier now after being nursed back to health by Hoon, and much of their journey together has been documented in I Live Alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno6q7qHnHqKanZZSWwaq6xmaeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./andrew-mccutchen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrew McCutchen [2023 Update]: Career &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
