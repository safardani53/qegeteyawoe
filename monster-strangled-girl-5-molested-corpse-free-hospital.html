Who is to say he will not commit another crime.”</p><p>It comes despite a chilling warning by New South Wales Supreme Court Justice David Patten that Kosowicz is "a plausible liar" who killed Chloe after being freed from psychiatric care.</p><p>The judge, who found Kosowicz not guilty of Chloe’s murder through mental illness, said after the 2005 case he found it “difficult to escape the conclusion that the community failed Chloe."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bag-kill3.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bag-kill4.png><p>Detectives found the bag containing blood-soaked clothing and sheets</p><p>He said: “Practitioners had known for years that the accused was a habitual and heavy user of illegal drugs; that he was mentally ill; that he was subject to florid psychiatric episodes in which he was aggressive and dangerous to himself and others; and that he was recalcitrant when it came to following regimens of medication laid down for him.</p><p>“Despite all this, he was repeatedly let back into the community after short periods of treatment.</p><p>“The outcome was catastrophic in the extreme."</p><p>In the most chilling warning, Justice Patten later added: “No doubt the authorities will take account of the above mentioned matters when, in due course, they consider whether the accused should be released back into the community and will also take into account the horrific circumstances of Chloe’s death and that the accused is quite capable of being a plausible liar."</p><p>Kosowicz’s own family have said he was a “ticking time bomb” before he killed Chloe.</p><p>His trial heard of more than four years of significant mental illness leading up to Chloe’s death, including numerous arrests and visits to hospital where he spoke of voices in his head.</p><p>The psychotic episodes continued and he was diagnosed with schizophrenia with threats of violence just weeks before he killed Chloe.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN WORLD NEWS</h2></p><p>Kosowicz initially lied to cops but then admitted he brutally assaulted her after she followed his cat into his cabin at a caravan park in Sydney’s&nbsp;west.</p><p>He <a href=#>graphically recounted in an interview how he strangled her then placed two bags over her head because he couldn’t kill her</a> and sexually assaulted her after she was dead.</p><p>He hid her in a sports bag along with bloody sheets as Chloe’s distraught family and emergency services frantically searched for her.</p><p>The next morning CCTV show him lugging the bag 200 yards to where he dumped her body next to a river.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>CCTV of Sydney child killer Tim Kosowicz carrying body of five-year-old girl Chloe Hoson to a creek in bag</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn1ygJhxZ2lnnaS7tMDEq2SsrKKWu6i4xJ1koKGioXp2ecyoo56rpJqxbq%2FOq6esnV2bv6axjKGmrKiZqa6tew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./preston-pohl-electric-feel-the-voice-blind-audition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Preston Pohl - Electric Feel (The Voice Blind Audition)">&larr;
