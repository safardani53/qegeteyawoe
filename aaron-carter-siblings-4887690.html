He reportedly inhaled difluoroethane (the flammable <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>propellant often used in cans of compressed air</a>), and alprazolam is a generic form of Xanax.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>His death was preceded by the death of older sister<strong> Leslie Carter</strong>, who died of an overdose of prescription medications in 2012. And on December 23, 2023, his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>older sister <strong>Bobbie Jean Carter</strong></a> died at the age of 41, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aaron-carter-life-in-photos-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Aaron, who was open about his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>struggle with addiction</a> and mental health, followed in his older siblings’ footsteps and made a name for himself in music as a teeny bopper, releasing his self-titled debut album in 1998 and a smash follow-up called Aaron’s Party (Come & Get It)&nbsp;in 2000. He also had two high profile romances with <strong>Hilary Duff</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Lindsay Lohan </strong>during his heyday. Later, his career was overshadowed by his personal battles and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> family drama</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite the ups and downs, though, Aaron was working on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>repairing his relationship</a> with big brother,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Carter</strong></a>, in the months before his death. Nick, as well as Aaron’s twin sister, <strong>Angel Carter</strong>, both even posted loving social media tributes to their brother after his passing, as well. Learn more about Aaron’s siblings and his relationship with them below.</p><h2>Nick Carter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aaron-carter-sibling-nick-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Born on January 28, 1980, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Carter</strong></a> is the oldest and the most well-known of the Carter bunch. After finding incredible fame in the 90s as a member of the iconic boyband, <strong>Backstreet Boys</strong>, Nick would go on to act in such films as Edward Scissorhands and television shows like 8 Simple Rules. He was also featured alongside the Backstreet Boys in Seth Rogan’s 2013 comedy This Is The End.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In 2014, Nick married YouTuber and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;fitness trainer</a>&nbsp;<strong>Lauren Kitt,&nbsp;</strong>38, after six years of dating. Together the pair have a son and two girls: <strong>Odin</strong>, <strong>Saoirse </strong>and <strong>Pearl</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Sadly, Nick and Aaron did not have the best relationship in recent years. In 2019, Nick revealed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> that he had filed a restraining order against Aaron. “In light of Aaron’s increasingly alarming behaviour and his recent confession that he harbors thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child, we were left with no choice but to take every measure possible to protect ourselves and our family,” he wrote. “We love our brother and truly hope he gets the proper treatment he needs before any harm comes to himself or anyone else.” Aaron reacted to the restraining order on his own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> at the time, writing, “Take care. @nickcarter we’re done for life.” He also denied ever “having thoughts of causing anyone pain, let alone taking anyone’s life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, as&nbsp;<strong>Hollywood Life</strong> exclusively reported, Aaron had “made amends and made peace” with Nick before his death. “They were trying to make things good again,” our source shared. Nick was absolutely devastated over the news of Aaron’s death. He performed with the Backstreet Boys in concert one day after Aaron’s passing and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was in tears</a> onstage. His bandmates comforted him as he got emotional during the set, which included a tribute to Aaron.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>On Nov. 6, Nick also took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pay tribute</a> to his little brother. “My heart is broken,” he wrote. “Even though my brother and I have had a complicated relationship, my love for him has never faded. I have always held on to the hope that he would somehow, someday want to walk a healthy path and eventually find the help he so desperately needed. Sometimes we want to blame someone or something for a loss, but the truth is that addiction and mental illness is the real villain here. I will miss my brother more than anyone will ever know. I love you Chizz. Now you can finally have the peace you could never find here on earth. God, please take care of my baby brother.”</p><h2>Angel Carter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aaron-carter-sibling-angel-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Angel is Aaron’s twin sister. The pair were quite close before Angel co-signed the restraining order with Nick against Aaron, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Huffington Post</a>. In fact, Aaron walked Angel down the aisle at her wedding back in 2014, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> CBS News</a>. At the ceremony, Angel married <strong>Corey Conrad</strong>, and they welcomed a daughter named <strong>Harper Conrad</strong> in 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Despite their rocky relationship in recent years, though, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Angel was devastated</a> by her brother’s passing. “To my twin…I loved you beyond measure,” she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “You will be missed dearly. My funny, sweet Aaron, I have so many memories of you and I, and I promise to cherish them. I know you’re at peace now. I will carry you with me until the day I die and get to see you again.” It’s unclear what the status of Angel and Aaron’s relationship was at the time of the singer’s death.</p><h2>Leslie Carter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Leslie Carter</strong></a> was welcomed on June 6, 1986 and had strong musical genes much like her talented siblings. Her single “Like Wow!” even appeared on the <i>Shrek</i> soundtrack. She then married <strong>Mike Ashton </strong>and welcomed daughter <strong>Alyssa</strong> on April 1, 2011.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Tragically, the young star was found unresponsive in her home in Mayville, New York on January 31, 2012 and was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital. Her cause of death was reported as an overdose, with three prescription drugs found near her body, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E!</a></p><h2>Bobbie Jean Carter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/aaron-carter-sibling-bobbie-leslie-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>Bobbie Jean Carter</strong> was born on January 12, 1982, and kept herself out of the spotlight until the siblings signed up for the reality show The House of Carters in 2006. However, she was in trouble with the law in 2002, when she was arrested for two counts of battery. Bobbie Jean had attacked two women whom she claimed “jumped” her sister Angel on Halloween, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RadarOnline</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bobbie Jean died</a> at the age of 41 in Florida on December 23, 2023, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. “I am in shock from learning of the sudden death of my daughter, Bobbie Jean, and I will need time to process the terrible reality of this happening for the third time,” their mother, <strong>Jane Carter</strong>, told the outlet the same day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>“When I am able to think clearly, I’ll release a fuller statement, but until then, I would request to be left to grieve in private,” she continued in her statement. “[H]owever deeply a parent feels the loss of a child, the suffering of a young child at the loss of a parent must be much greater. So, I would ask the sympathetic to say a prayer for my precious eight-year-old granddaughter <strong>Bella</strong>, who previously lost her father and is now also left without her mother.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Multiple sources told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> for a December 26 report that the family believes she suffered a cardiac arrest. A Carter family insider told the outlet that she will be laid to rest in Florida.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Aaron’s team also responded to her death with a heartfelt statement on December 26. “This year has definitely been one with such loss and tragedy,” they wrote in the statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News.</a> “May you be filled with love and comfort from supporting fans and friends through this tough time. You are not alone. We know Aaron is in heaven with his sisters and reunited. May they rest in peace.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Later that week, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reported that authorities found Bobbie Jean unresponsive in her bathroom at the time of her death — eerily similar to that of Aaron’s death. At the start of 2024, Nick <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke his silence</a> about his late sister’s death.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“It may take a lifetime to fully process the loss my family has endured over the years – most recently, with the sudden passing of our sister Bobbie Jean. I am completely heartbroken,” Nick write via Instagram in January 2024. “Thank you for all your love and kind words. We are reminded again that life is precious, fleeting and to cherish the time we have with the ones we love. I know she is finally at peace with God. I love you, BJ.”</p><h2>Virginia Marie Carter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Born in October, 1972, Virginia Marie Carter is Aaron’s half-sister from his father’s first marriage. Little is known about the eldest of the extended Carter brood.</p><h2>Taelyn Dobson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>The only step-sibling of Aaron,<strong> Taelyn Dobson</strong> is the daughter of <strong>Ginger Elrod</strong>, who married Aaron’s father in 2003, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. As Taelyn is quite private, little is known about her in the public forum.</p><h2>Kaden Brent Carter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-24>While there is very little known about <strong>Kaden Brent Carter</strong>, who was born on June 7, 2005, he does have an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> with his buddy, where the teenagers share snaps from high school.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CaqaimXZius8DEq2SsoZKhtq%2Bz0mZrcXBna4Zxew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./planetary-alignment-march-2023-everything-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How and When to Spot It">&larr;
