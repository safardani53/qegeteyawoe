The state is surprised. The state believes Mr. Edwards doesn’t want to take his probation seriously. It’s good he passed a drug screen.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Ryan Edwards ">Read more on Ryan Edwards</h2><p>“He needs the Vivitrol shot. He was a couple of weeks late on it. My request would be we monitor his progress and ask the court to submit the report on his progress, including his AA meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>“All of that should be simple for someone on a rehabilitation track to do well and doesn’t want to go to jail for years.”</p><p>Ryan’s lawyer responded: “He passed his drug screening. He should’ve been more diligent with the court’s requirements. The ultimate objective of those requirements is he doesn’t use. And he hasn’t used.”</p><p>But Judge Starnes fired back: “There was plenty of time for him to get it out of his system from the time took the test."&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>His lawyer then claimed he has the shot scheduled for December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Starnes said: “I don't know how many more opportunities Mr. Edwards is entitled to. He has failed to do what he’s supposed to. He’s been revoked and put in jail for almost three months. He’s had violations at Oasis and CADAS, but they didn’t kick him out.</p><p>"He wants to stand here and ask for more time to do it. How many more chances does Mr. Edwards think he’s going to get? What do you think when he doesn’t follow the program? He has gotten so many chances and every single time he got an opportunity to do things he should’ve been doing. Now he’s back again.</p><p>“Today, out of nowhere he sets up the shot. You shouldn’t have to tell him that. It’s simple. Time and time again he shows he will not do it until he is made to do it. Here we are today.</p><p>"If he were released today, he would do the same thing today. Going 145 in a 65 mph speed zone is not the greatest decision. I could revoke him on that. How many times does he think he’s going to be entitled?&nbsp;</p><p>“He’s been to three different rehab facilities in Texas, he voluntarily left and didn’t do what he was supposed to do. He showed up down here passed out in a truck and had to be Narcaned several times. He was given more chances then, more rehab.</p><p>"Here we are. He was in an altercation at a bar, he was dragged out. His decision-making throughout his, he has not improved at all."</p><p>Ryan’s lawyer responded: “Mr. Edwards doesn’t feel entitled… when someone has a drug problem, stopping that is a battle. Based on his latest screen, that shows progress, that shows he’s trying. Is he doing everything ordered? No sir. But I think he’s going to try.”</p><p>Judge Starnes fired back: “He’s been drug tested several times in custody, in CADAS and Oasis, he’s negative. As far as his addiction, it’s successful. He’s not willing to do anything he’s told. He’s not blaming it on addiction today.”</p><p>Judge Starnes then let Ryan speak, as he said: “It’s not like I was not trying to get that shot. I do go to AA meetings. I was not trying to ignore your court. I intended to do it. They only take the first two people. When I enrolled, I got the date to go. It was on the court date at 2.”</p><p>Judge Starnes responded: “You had plenty of days to go back and get it. You did miss two meetings over the Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p>“You backed the court into a corner you continued to do that. We gave you chance after chance. You’re not on drugs, you’re negative. You’re not going to follow anything you’ve been told to do."</p><p>Ryan responded: “I will have that shot.”</p><p>Judge Starnes then said: “You scheduled it cause you were in front of me.</p><p>“I am not going to continue to be your babysitter. You’re a grown adult. You always take the wrong route. You have kids. You do what you think you’re going to do.”</p><p>Ryan answered: “I am sorry. I will do what I am supposed to do.”</p><p>When DA Coty said she would be fine to let him out to get the shot on December 12, the judge responded: “How many more chances do we need to give him?”</p><p>She responded: “If he failed the drug screen, I would argue he needs to spend time months in custody. I don’t know if there is an option for him to get it in jail. I’m at a loss. My concern is public safety. My concern is the DUI, the reckless driving."</p><p>Judge Starnes then said: “He put himself in the bullseye. If I let him out, he’ll be right back here. Sending him back to rehab won’t help. He won’t do what he’s supposed to do."</p><p>Ryan pleaded: “Give me one more chance to show…”</p><p>But Judge Starnes cut him off and said: “I have given you chance after chance. I’m glad to see you’re not on drugs. That’s very important.</p><p>"I’m going to move this to January 17.&nbsp; My inclination is to have you serve three years. I’ll move this to January 17. We can try to get you the shot in jail. I’m not going out of my way. Your attorney can help you. We’ll do a furlough for them to take you there and get it back.”</p><p>When Judge Starnes asked him for the time of the shot, Ryan responded that he wasn’t sure, as his family made the appointment.&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Starnes said: “They do have phones. It’s always an excuse.”</p><p>Ryan will be in jail until his January 17 court hearing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SUPPORT IN THE COURT</h2><p>His mother, Jen, and father, Larry, were in attendance.</p><p>They sat towards the back of the gallery in support of their troubled son.</p><p>Jen cried hysterically as Judge Starnes spoke.</p><p>Ryan's girlfriend Amanda was also in attendance and seemed emotional throughout the hearing.</p><p>She shook her head in disagreement when Judge Starnes came down hard on Ryan.</p><p>She sat in front of Jen and Larry in the gallery, but did not speak to them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RECENT TROUBLE</h2><p>The U.S. Sun previously obtained an exclusive video of <a href=#>Ryan being kicked out of a bar</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan and his <a href=#>girlfriend, Amanda Conner</a>, went to Westbound Honky-Tonk in Chattanooga, Tennessee on Saturday, November 25.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, Ryan could be seen being dragged out of the bar by bouncers, as he is seen yelling while being shoved out at around 10:30pm.</p><p>Amanda could also be seen being hauled out by security in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>An eyewitness exclusively told The U.S. Sun of the brawl that led to the couple getting kicked out: “Ryan and Amanda were with a group of people. At one point, one of the guys in their group went up to Amanda and grabbed her by the face.&nbsp;</p><p>“Amanda came back at him and started slinging chairs to go after the guy. The bouncers grabbed the guy and kicked him out. Amanda was able to get her last hit in before they got her out too.</p><p>“Ryan tried to get to Amanda, but he was dragged out by bouncers as well. Ryan and Amanda left the bar together on foot.”</p><p>The insider continued that while the couple were not seen drinking alcohol, Ryan could be heard “slurring his words” and appeared “out of it.”</p><p>Ryan was also <a href=#>found guilty of driving 145mph in a 65mph zone</a> on his motorcycle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'CHANCE AFTER CHANCE'</h2><p>At the December 5 hearing, District Attorney Coty said, referring to the video: "I would be interested to see if he could pass a drug screening. Last time was November 8, the same time he was released from Oasis [halfway house].</p><p>"It raises concern he could fail a drug screening. If he’s not doing CADAS outpatient, he’s not doing the support groups. Can we drug test him in court today, judge?"</p><p>Judge Starnes responded: "Yes, if you can get someone down here."</p><p>After an hour, Ryan was called to the stand.</p><p>DA Coty said: "He is late for his vivitrol shot. He was supposed to get it on November 17. We know what happens when you go longer than a month.</p><p>"The rehab representative believes it is way past overdue. That would correspond with his behavior at the bar. He was drug-screened yesterday. By Friday we will have those results back.</p><p>"The state would ask he be taken into custody if he does not pass. He agreed to submit a report on his continuing care and follow-up. He hasn’t done it. If he does not do that by Friday and show he went to AA... If he doesn’t go, if he fails drug screens, the state will file this petition."</p><p>Judge Starnes sternly responded: "He's going into custody. He was told to do it. My patience is gone. You had chance after chance after chance. The results will be back Friday."</p><p>Ryan asked: "Your honor, can I speak?"</p><p>Judge Starnes responded: "No, you can’t."</p><p>Ryan was <a href=#>handcuffed on the spot</a> and taken out of the courtroom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HARSH SENTENCE</h2><p>After the hearing, District Attorney Coty <a href=#>filed a Petition to Revoke Defendant's Probation</a>.</p><p>Court papers exclusively obtained by The U.S. Sun read: "The Defendant is currently on probation for Harassment, Possession of a Controlled Substance, and Driving Under the Influence.</p><p>"On each of these charges, Defendant Edwards was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days, each ordered to run consecutively to one another, for an effective sentence of three years on Hamilton County Probation."</p><p>The court papers then mention his Continuing Care Contract, which is part of his plea deal, where he agreed to: "1. Attend four 12-step support groups per week. 2. Attend Aftercare Group meetings either on Tuesdays or Thursdays each month for a period of 12 months. 3. Keep counseling plus vivitrol appointments, the next one scheduled for 11-17-2023.</p><p>"Furthermore, the defendant agreed to 'submit a comprehensive report for follow-up treatment to the court.'"</p><p>The court papers continued: "The Defendant has failed to complete any of the above recommendations that Defendant agreed to complete as part of Defendant's plea agreement."</p><p>The document also notes Ryan is required to take monthly drug screenings, with his last drug screen taken immediately after he was discharged from treatment with a negative result.</p><p>He had not been drug screened again until Monday.</p><p>The court papers then mentioned The U.S. Sun's <a href=#>exclusive video</a> of the bar incident.&nbsp;</p><p>The document read: "It also recently came to the State's attention that the Defendant was involved in an altercation at a local bar in which the Defendant had to be forcibly removed from the bar by security.</p><p>"For these reasons, the State petitions this Court to revoke the Defendant's probation and require Defendant to serve the balance of his sentence at Hamilton County Jail."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>PLEA DEAL HEARING</strong></h2><p>At his<a href=#> November 6</a> court hearing, Coty for the District Attorney's Office brought up his <a href=#>October 7 ticket for speeding 145mph in a 65mph zone</a> on his motorcycle.&nbsp;</p><p>He received a citation and was charged with reckless driving and other counts.</p><p>Coty of the plea deal: "The State is hesitant to agree to this, the reason is because of a citation in City Court on October 7. He was on radar going 145mph in a 65mph.</p><p>"Why he was not taken to jail? It should’ve been reckless endangerment. I don't think he's ready to succeed on any probation. I expressed concern to CADAS that he is not ready to take probation or bond conditions seriously."</p><p>The lawyer continued: "But taking the facts into consideration and the Oasis report that would indicate Mr. Edwards is doing well, the State has made this agreement."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>JUDGE'S DECISION</strong></h2><p>Judge Starnes responded: “I will go over the plea agreement. On the original probation, you will be reinstated for 11 months and 29 days suspended. You will be on level two probation with random drug screenings.</p><p>"For the DUI case, you're pleading guilty. Eleven months and 29 days are suspended after you serve 48 hours, and you already served 48 hours.</p><p>"There will be a $465 fine plus, court costs. You lose your license for a year. You have to attend DUI school."</p><p>“For the simple possession, you will get drug screenings also. You're pleading guilty. Eleven months and 29 days time served.</p><p>"The possession of a controlled substance case is dismissed."</p><p>When asked if Ryan agreed to the deal, he accepted.</p><p>Judge Starnes continued: “I'm very hesitant to approve it. You going 145 in a 65 doesn’t show me remorse and the ignorance of doing something like that is beyond me. I don't know how you didn’t kill somebody.</p><p>"I don’t want to approve this. You have to give the court a comprehensive follow-up plan. There have been hiccups the entire world knows about.</p><p>“Continue what CADAS and Oasis recommended. I don’t want him out there with no follow-up program.</p><p>"You have the ability to do this, but you need to make good decisions. Going 145 on a motorcycle is not a good idea. He has to follow this program's recommendations."</p><p>The lawyer for the state recommended continuing Vivitrol injections, which curb addiction cravings, and counseling.</p><p>Judge Starnes ended the hearing: “Mr. Edwards we’ve gone over this many, many times. You have done well with the shots and CADAS treatments.</p><p>"You haven’t been good in your personal life. You’re looking at three years in custody. If you get on your motorcycle and decide you want to do it again, three years is a long time.”</p><p>Ryan was <a href=#>found guilty of the speeding charge</a> on November 8 and was ordered to pay fines.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SECOND CHANCE</strong></h2><p>Ryan was originally <a href=#>sentenced to 11 months and 29 days</a> in Silverdale Detention Center in April for the possession of a controlled substance, simple possession and driving under the influence charges.</p><p>He was <a href=#>released to rehab in July</a> and to a halfway house in August.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>RYAN’S BUSTS</strong></h2><p>Ryan has been in and out of jail since earlier this year on drug, harassment, and other charges.&nbsp;</p><p>He was <a href=#>arrested on February 10, 2023 at his job for harassment</a>, possession of <a href=#>drug</a> paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance, and order of protection violation.&nbsp;</p><p>He was then <a href=#>arrested for aggravated stalking</a> and violating a protection order on March 1 after authorities <a href=#>issued two warrants for his arrest</a> on February 23.&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan <a href=#>pleaded guilty to the harassment charge</a> at a court hearing, <a href=#>The Ashley's Reality Roundup</a> reported.</p><p>The former TV personality was ordered to complete rehab treatment and have no contact with the victim.</p><p>He was put on probation for 11 months and 29 days.</p><p>The possession of drug paraphernalia, stalking and order of protection violation charges were dismissed.</p><p>As for his possession of a controlled substance, he was sentenced to rehab with the option of the time being reduced for good behavior after six months.</p><p>He was then arrested on April 7 for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence arrest, which are the same charges as the plea deal, after the <a href=#>Teen Mom OG</a> alum was <a href=#>found unconscious in the driver’s seat of his truck</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>NEW LOVE</strong></h2><p>Ryan <a href=#>met Amanda in rehab</a> when he was released from prison in July.&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda, who <a href=#>once appeared on Jerry Springer</a>, has <a href=#>been in and out of jail</a> from around 2009 to a few months ago on drug possession, driving under the influence and more charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda posted on Instagram that Ryan had called her from prison.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>His <a href=#>divorce from Mackenzie Edwards</a>, who he shares Jagger, 4, and Stella, 3, with, remains ongoing.</p><p>He also shares son Bentley, 14, with ex Maci Bookout.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) at 1-800-662-HELP (4357)</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/2023-edwards-now-stay-jail-864947261.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/2023-edwards-now-stay-jail-864947135.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/pics-video-ryan-edwards-taken-864280439-4.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGZ%2Fdn2SaKuenZ5iurC5jKuwmqZdmrG4rdGdqmacoqq0bsDErKtmqpWowq3A0makqKaknXqrrcilZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-maura-west-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Maura West Dating Now">&larr;
