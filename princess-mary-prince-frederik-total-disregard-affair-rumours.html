Queen Margrethe II - <a href=#>announced her surprise abdication.</a></p><p>In November it was claimed <a href=#>Prince Frederik </a>was having an affair with Mexican socialite and MasterChef star Genoveva Casanova.</p><p>Genoveva has insisted claims of any romance are "malicious" and "categorically" untrue and that the “photos prove nothing” other than them being “friends” - and the royals haven’t commented on the speculation.</p><p>As Frererik, 55, arrived at the event with Mary, 51, who were both dressed in formal attire, they kept a dignified distance and barely exchanged any words with one another.</p><p>Body language expert Judi James told Fabulous: “Wearing their formal attire here it seems almost natural for Mary and Frederik to walk in a way that shows an almost total disregard for each other."</p><p>However, she claims Mary displayed “new confidence” as an imminent Queen-to-be.</p><p>Judi added: “Mary’s <span id=1c01a6ae-db23-4323-bc63-64e9ef9615bb class=suggested-link>power</span> and status signals have increased, as she seems to have been handed the opportunity to build her own independent power-base if that is what she wants.</p><p>“Her upright posture and assertive smile suggest new levels of confidence and even some sense of justification.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Royals</h2></p><p>“ She can now build her popularity in her own right rather than acting as a supportive wife to her husband.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are no signs of any connection between the two in these photos when there might have been some exchanged glances or tie-signs.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is a slight air of awkwardness from Frederik but Mary seems to be moving into a place of renewed confidence and resilience.”</p><p>Queen <a href=#>Margrethe II</a>, 83, who took over the throne in 1972, announced her plan to <a href=#>give up the throne during a New Year's Eve speech</a> on Sunday, and will be succeeded by <span id=33d15976-e1a8-4b09-8bc0-f91852013b73 class=suggested-link>Prince</span> Frederik on January 14, after 52 years on the throne.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=0c234e42-f444-45c5-8c84-eba07259b2f6 class=suggested-link>The Queen</span> has two sons, <a href=#>Prince Frederik</a> and Prince Joachim, with her late husband, Prince Henrik.</p><p>In her New Year's Eve speech, the Queen said: "I leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik."</p><p>Frederik has been married to Princess Mary since 2004, and she will be the world's first Australia-born queen.</p><p>The pair, who met in a pub in Sydney in 2000, are <a href=#>known for their low-key lifestyle</a>.</p><p>There has been reported speculation about Frederik and Mary's <span id=94ca4b18-93d5-4141-a2bf-68309e3caaf5 class=suggested-link>marriage</span>, particularly in recent months.</p><p>But no claims about the details of the royal couple's relationship have been confirmed.</p><p>Prince Frederik first set eyes on his future wife, dubbed a Kate Middleton lookalike, at a bar called the Slip Inn during the 2000 <span id=a9a772bc-0396-44a5-b6f9-19bb50838e5b class=suggested-link>Summer</span> Olympics in Sydney.</p><p>Although he was at the bar with other high profile royals including the future king of <span id=e330c6af-1a34-4eef-a652-94ee289fc545 class=suggested-link>Spain</span>, Mary reportedly had no idea who he was.</p><p>He even introduced himself to her as <span id=5e9e0c20-392c-4a55-8964-502dc4d1ab79 class=suggested-link>Fred</span>, and left out the fact that he was the heir to the Danish throne.</p><p>Mary and Frederik soon began a long distance relationship - with the prince often sneaking off to <span id=0d49b9ac-d078-476a-867d-9b75ddb983f5 class=suggested-link>Australia</span> to spend time with her.</p><p>In May 2004, the couple married in an emotional ceremony, with Prince Frederik captured wiping away tears as his bride walked down the aisle.</p><p>They share four children, Prince Christian, 18, Princess Isabella, 16, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 12, who they chose to send to normal <span id=8e6d4c2d-8808-4576-a5bd-6d14c7ee1519 class=suggested-link>schools</span> after a <span id=440ea7a1-30d5-4afe-a356-434f5cd81848 class=suggested-link>documentary</span> revealed a culture of <span id=550cc564-54dc-4fef-985c-63cc0e8c2e57 class=suggested-link>bullying</span> and abuse at their former school - the elite Herlufsholm.</p><p>Mary has previously been compared to Princess Kate, as neither were aristocrats but both came from well-connected families before marrying their respective royal husbands.</p><p>They also bear a striking resemblance and have a similar taste in clothes.</p><p>The pair, both brunettes with stunning smiles, are even the same body type, although at 51, the Aussie-born addition to <span id=b52d33b1-9255-47c0-9a04-8c75307cb297 class=suggested-link>Denmark</span>'s <span id=0bcba994-a86c-4f26-a606-89e53e4080e4 class=suggested-link>royal family</span> is a decade older.</p><p>Mary's appreciation of Kate's stylish <span id=c99f58b8-9dd0-437c-9036-b9908019209c class=suggested-link>threads</span> may have started as early as 2011, when they met in Copenhagen.</p><p>There Kate wore a long red £345 LK Bennett coat and Italian Vecceli belt - a look later replicated by Mary, who is married to Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik.</p><p>Kate has long been a fashion trail-blazer whose outfits sell-out within minutes of her wearing them in public.</p><p>But Princess Mary, was touted as the most stylish - after the mum-of-four once took the title ahead of nine others including the then-Duchess of Cambridge and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands.</p><p>The 2016 award - decided by a readers’ poll created by <span id=b41d902f-2181-48dc-977f-bb281d7917c0 class=suggested-link>celebrity</span> magazine Hello! - put Kate, mum to Charlotte, George and Louis, in second place.</p><p>The result didn't surprise fans of the Danish Princess, who is known for her fashion-forward style and makes regular appearances on global fashion lists.</p><p>Just last year the Danish royal family was divided over a row about royal titles.</p><p>Queen Margrethe chose to <a href=#>strip four of her grandchildren of their royal titles</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She removed the titles from her youngest son, Prince Joachim's, children.</p><p>But Mary and Frederik's children, who will soon move up in the line of <span id=ac49b9f5-ca8f-4cf9-a4f9-694048f6fcac class=suggested-link>succession</span>, kept theirs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/NINTCHDBPICT000869696927.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/genoveva-casanova-attends-casa-mo-869415190.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/prince-frederik-princess-mary-children-765420880-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2000-mary-donaldson-met-heir-869421740-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2022-copenhagen-denmark-duchess-cambridge-714022626.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/verified-royal-highness-crown-princess-765416504.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570aiwmqSjZH5xfI9wb3JqX6W%2FqrrCnqqsZZ2Wv7p5z6ugp5uVYrOzscOeqaKjXam8ta3LZpuiq6KatKK%2Bw2aYn56Rnr9uvtSmpq6qo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./queen-bassist-john-deacon-cigarette.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Queen bassist John Deacon, 69, puffs on a cigarette while out on a stroll in London">&larr;
