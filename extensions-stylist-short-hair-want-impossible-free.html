You have an extremely short bob. I can try to make them blend as best as possible, but you have a lot of layers and your hair is very short and in my personal opinion I would not do extensions that are that long."</p><p>"We would need to really thin them out and layer them a BUNCH to make them try to blend as much as we can" she added.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>The client refused to have any layers put in her hair and insisted the stylist leave her hair all one length.</p><p>"Oh no. No-no-no. I want em all one length. I don't want any layers, no texture, I want them long, super-thick. Khaleesi hair" said the client.</p><p>The stylist once again said that in her professional opinion she would not do that, but would do what the client asked.</p><p>China said: "I just wanna make sure you know that unless you do your hair extremely straight every single day and keep that short hair down, It's not gonna blend very well."</p><p>Adding: "I just want you to know that, I don't want you to have to start wearing a hat every day. I just don't think it's gonna look the best but I will do whatever you want me to do."</p><p>As the client insisted, the stylist did her hair and asked the client what she thought of them.</p><p>"So I know you were honest with me from the beginning, but this looks really funky. Like you put a lot of extensions in, I don't know. It does look kinda weird" said the client.</p><p>China offered to layer and texture the hair, which the client refused and said she would see how she felt.</p><p>A few days later the client called in and made a complaint about the stylist, as well as asking for a refund and free service.</p><p>The client said: "China messed up my hair the other day and I would like a full refund and my hair looks disgusting and I want it fixed like now."</p><p>The post has been viewed over 603k times and TikTok users have been quick to comment.</p><p>"Please tell me they did not get a refund!" commented one person.</p><p>“'I know it turned out the way you told me, but still I want to blame you'” another added.</p><p>A third commented: "</p><p>Just refuse to do it. No is better than getting your name blasted because they can’t listen."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ddaa12dc-a9c3-45c2-8e22-20e566678dd6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000193269179.jpg><p>For more on hair.., see how one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woman raves about budget B&M hairdryer gives glossy locks in seconds with NO tangle</a>s.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Also, see how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one bridezilla kicked her friend out of her wedding for cutting her hair -for medical reasons.</a></p><p>And see...<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m a hairdresser and mums are the rudest customers and ALWAYS ask for the same thing when I’ve cut their kids’ hair</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BwaHBuYm2FcLHXrZynq5mku7R50q2wpaGjqXq0tM6rq2agkZ6%2FbsPAp6tmoZ2lvLS%2FyJujnmWWp7Kmew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jenna-dewan-tatum-shows-off-post-baby-body-in-witches-of-east-end-clip-2013259.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenna Dewan-Tatum Post-Baby Body: Star Sizzles on Witches of East End">&larr;
