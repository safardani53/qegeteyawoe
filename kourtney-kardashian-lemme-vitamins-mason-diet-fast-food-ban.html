He'll tell me, 'A person was bad because they let me have Cheetos.'"</p><h2>SO EXTREME</h2><p>Even with the news of Kourtney's business launching, fans were wound up about Mason's strict diet rules.</p><p>Fans took to online forums to discuss Kourtney's parenting choices.</p><p>One critic posted: "The poor kid just wants SOME sense of NORMAL."</p><p>Another agreed and posted: "Right? That's so sad. The kid just wants some d**n French fries."</p><p>A third fan slammed: "Good job to Kourtney for forever screwing up her kids' relationship with food."</p><p>Yet a fourth said: "I can’t believe she thinks this sort of parenting skill is something to boast about."</p><p>A fifth shared: "Honestly, she's not helping her kids by doing that. Once Mason is old enough to drive himself she won't be able to stop him.</p><p>"Better to teach him it's okay to have it every once in a while."</p><p>Yet a sixth fan concluded: "It’s amazing to teach your kids to eat healthy and enjoy healthy foods, but being overly extreme or restrictive is just going to create problems."</p><h2>LEMME KNOW!</h2><p>Previously, The U.S. Sun reported on Kourtney's <a href=#>secret business plans for Lemme</a> partnering up with her long-time family friend Simon Huck, 38.</p><p>According to documents obtained exclusively by The U.S. Sun, Kourtney filed a trademark for Lemme on February 19, 2022.</p><p>In addition to the vitamins and pharmaceuticals, Lemme will include the production of "bags, purses, totes, wallets, clutches and clothing."</p><p>Other categories included in the trademark are listed as "games, toys and sporting goods."</p><p>The U.S. Sun can also reveal Kourtney turned to her family friend Simon, the owner of the successful New York public relations firm Command Entertainment Group.</p><p>Kourtney has partnered up with Simon's New York business to help promote the launch of Lemme - and he even dropped a cheeky comment in her post.</p><h2>VITAMIN K</h2><p>However, Kourtney may potentially have plans for expanding her vitamin business rapidly.</p><p>The U.S. Sun also revealed Kourtney <a href=#>filed for a second trademark</a> for a business called Unplug the same day she filed for Lemme.</p><p>Unplug's trademark is - similar to Lemme - intended to cover the categories of "vitamins, supplements, vitamin-fortified food and beverages and vitamin cases."</p><p>The secret trademark also includes: "Adhesives; chemicals and chemical compositions; medicines and pharmaceutical preparations; dental, medical and surgical appliances; foods and ingredients of foods; cosmetics and toilet preparations, and detergents and soaps."</p><p>Kourtney isn't stopping there, however.</p><p>Unplug's trademark also covers: "Dietetic substances adapted for medical use; food for babies; plasters; materials for dressings; material for stopping teeth; dental wax; disinfectants; preparations for destroying vermin, fungicides and herbicides."</p><p>Although Lemme and Unplug were filed on the same day, it is unclear yet if the two trademarked businesses are connected or not.</p><p>Kourtney has not announced anything about her plans for Unplugged yet - but she may be saving the news as a counter-move to her sister&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>&nbsp;who announced her new venture&nbsp;<a href=#>SKKY Partners</a>&nbsp;the same week.</p><h2>'SO UNHEALTHY'</h2><p>Kourtney's parenting decisions aren't the first time fans have been concerned over how the star promotes her dieting lifestyle on social media.</p><p>Earlier in August, Kourtney was <a href=#>slammed for promoting bad habits </a>and eating disorders for an article posted on her Poosh website - the star's first wellness company.</p><p>The article addressed eating while bored: a major cause of obesity in the United States.</p><p>Although some fans felt Kourtney addressed the topic flippantly, as she shared a photo of a bowl full of food and captioned it: "Am I hungry, or just bored?"</p><p>Fans took to online forums to voice their divided opinions.</p><p>One complained: "This article made me irrationally mad. I have a lot of friends who struggle with [eating disorders] and this mentality is really toxic.</p><p>"Poosh is really giving early 2000s unhealthy weight loss magazines."</p><p>Another weighed in: "It just states that some people eat when they’re bored, which is different than eating when hungry... Okay?</p><p>"Do some people really not know that? What is the point of this article?</p><p>"Like every other article on Poosh - complete trash."</p><p>Although other fans came to&nbsp;<a href=#>the Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star's defense and supported the article.</p><p>"This is not toxic at all lol. This is a valid question," one person commented.</p><p>"Overeating is a major issue for a lot of people.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It’s kinda annoying when people get triggered by something and make things about themselves when it’s actually a really valid and applicable discussion for a lot of other people."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another person added: "The U.S. has a huge obesity problem and boredom eating plays a big role in that. This is a valid question."</p><p>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call or text the National Eating Disorders Association at 800-931-2237, or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chat with volunteers onlin</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-dinner-710366212.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-take-654519314-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/taken-without-permission-brand-tagged-760298392-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYmV%2Fd3yRaKKoraKpu6bFjKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mo56lnZp6t7XTmqSipqNiuqK%2FzqdknaGVqXqnrdKtZJ%2Bnn5l6o63NaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kylie-jenner-stassie-karanikolaou-mom-died-mourn-heartbreaking.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Jenner's BFF Stassie Karanikolaou reveals her mom has died as she mourns loss in heartbreaking">&larr;
